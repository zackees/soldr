"""Every Dylint nightly pin in the tree must agree (soldr#2817).

soldr fetches a **prebuilt** Dylint driver keyed on `<dylint-version>-<nightly>`
and refuses to build one from source:

    Dylint v6.0.3 is not built for this machine (host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu;
    missing or unusable component: dylint-driver for nightly-2026-04-16).
    Soldr will not build Dylint from source.

So a file that pins its own nightly does not merely get a different compiler —
it gets *no driver at all*. `ci/fixtures/dylint-cache` was on
`nightly-2026-04-16` while every real dylint had moved to `nightly-2026-05-28`,
and the Dylint Cache and Cook acceptance lanes failed every scheduled run for
three weeks. Both are scheduled-only, so no PR ever ran them.

This is a source check rather than a lane check for that reason: the lanes that
would have caught it are exactly the ones nobody watches.
