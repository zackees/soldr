"""Regression locks for the folded-run-block guard.

soldr#3018 found the bug this guards against the expensive way: `ci.yml`'s
macOS queue watchdog hid `--grace-seconds 2700` behind a `#` inside a
`run: >-` scalar, so the shell dropped it and the watchdog ran at its 900s
default for as long as that was true. Every failure looked like the flaky
lane it was watching.
