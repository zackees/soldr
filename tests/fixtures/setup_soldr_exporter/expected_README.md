# setup-soldr

Public GitHub Action for installing one released `soldr` binary, provisioning the resolved Rust toolchain with `rustup`, and restoring a cacheable runner-local root for Soldr, Cargo, and rustup state.

This repository is intended to be generated from `zackees/soldr`. The source-of-truth contract and release process still live in `soldr` issue #137 and `docs/SETUP_SOLDR_PUBLIC_ACTION.md`.

## Inputs

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | Soldr release tag or version to install. Empty means latest release. |
| `cache` | Restore and save the action-managed cache/state root. |
| `cache-dir` | Override the runner-local cache/state root. |
| `cache-key-suffix` | Optional escape hatch appended to the cache key. |
| `toolchain` | Explicit Rust toolchain channel override. |
| `toolchain-file` | Alternate toolchain file path when `toolchain` is empty. |
| `trust-mode` | Optional `SOLDR_TRUST_MODE` value. |
| `build-cache` | Restore and save the zccache compilation artifact cache. |
| `target-cache` | Restore and save the Cargo target directory for no-op CI fast paths. |
| `target-dir` | Cargo target directory restored by `target-cache`. |

## Outputs

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `soldr-path` | Installed Soldr binary path added to `PATH`. |
| `soldr-version` | Installed Soldr version reported by `soldr version --json`. |
| `cache-dir` | Action-managed runner-local cache/state root. |
| `cache-hit` | Whether the action restored an exact cache hit. |
| `build-cache-hit` | Whether the zccache compilation cache was restored. |
| `target-cache-hit` | Whether the Cargo target directory cache was restored. |
| `toolchain` | Exact Rust toolchain channel configured for the action. |

## Notes

- The action installs exactly one released `soldr` binary for the active runner target.
- The normal path provisions Rust with `rustup`; on self-hosted runners, `rustup` must already be available.
- The action rehydrates `SOLDR_CACHE_DIR`, `CARGO_HOME`, and `RUSTUP_HOME` under the selected cache root.
- The action restores Soldr's zccache cache root under `SOLDR_CACHE_DIR` and the Cargo target directory by default so child branches can reuse parent-branch build state.
- Managed `zccache` artifact storage uses `ZCCACHE_CACHE_DIR` when the managed zccache version supports that override.

## Development

Regenerate this repository bundle from the source repository with the exporter in `zackees/soldr`.
