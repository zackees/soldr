"""Recovery guest and explicitly opted-in hosted macOS lane contracts.

This replaces tests/test_macos_dockur_lane_contract.py, whose contract (a
hand-baked dockur/macos image pulled from GHCR over ssh, soldr#3071) never
worked: the image was never published and the ssh secret was never set, so
`e2e-macos-x64` and `smoke_macos_x64` failed at preflight on every run.
soldr#3076 replaces that whole plan with zackees/docker-mac-x64, which needs
neither.
