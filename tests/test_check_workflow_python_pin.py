"""The interpreter-pin guard must catch an unpinned job, and only that (soldr#2763).

The bug it guards: a workflow job runs `.github/scripts/*.py` under whatever
`python3` the runner image happens to ship. That killed the v0.9.3 release on
macOS ARM64 with `'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'hardlink_to'` -- a 3.10+
API on an image whose python3 was older.

Two directions matter here and they fail differently. Missing a genuinely
unpinned job lets the release bug back in. Flagging a pinned one -- or a job
that runs no repo Python at all -- makes the guard noise, and a noisy guard gets
baselined into uselessness, which is the same outcome more slowly.
