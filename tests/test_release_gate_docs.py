"""soldr#2469 step 1.2: the release docs must describe the live gates.

The 0.9.0 incident was survivable partly because nobody could tell from the
docs what was actually enforced. RELEASE.md, SECURITY.md and
docs/RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md described branch protection and release-time
re-validation that do not exist. Those three were corrected; this pins the
correction so it cannot rot back, and fails when a doc claims a control the
workflow does not implement.

The checks are deliberately narrow. They assert the *shape* of a claim against
the workflow, not prose style, so a rewrite that stays truthful still passes.
