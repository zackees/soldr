# soldr Python tests

`pytest`-driven tests for the Python surfaces that ship alongside the
Rust crates: the `setup-soldr` GitHub Action helpers, the exporter, and
the CI benchmark report. Rust crate tests live under `crates/*/tests/`
and `crates/*/src/**_tests.rs`.

## Running

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

Heavy Docker checks are opt-in:

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_nextest_archive_cacheability.py --cacheability-integration
```

That check runs `ci/assert_nextest_archive_cacheability.py`, which builds
the full `soldr cargo nextest archive --workspace` path twice in
Linux Docker, forcing the warm pass with `cargo clean` and a soldr cache
daemon restart.

**What it asserts (soldr#2937, phase 5 of soldr#2931).** On the warm rebuild,
*dependency* compilation units must hit the compiler cache. Test-harness
**link** products are reported with their miss counts and are explicitly not
required to be hits.

This replaced the soldr#1391 invariant, which required the full **linked** test
archive to be warm-cacheable at positive hits and zero misses. soldr#2931
inverted that: cache admission follows the stability of an artifact's identity
key relative to its size, and a linked test product has the least stable key
and one of the largest sizes in the build, so it is never cacheable. The old
rule was asking the store to carry exactly what the policy forbids.

The verdict itself lives in `evaluate_warm_result` and is unit-tested without
Docker in `test_nextest_archive_cacheability.py` — a 40-minute acceptance is
the worst possible place to discover a classification bug.

Repository-wide, the same policy is enforced statically by
`.github/scripts/check_cache_ownership.py` against the ownership manifest
`ci/cache-ownership.json`, which classifies every persisted artifact class in
this repo as `cook`, `zccache-unit`, `none`, or a named exception. That guard
runs in the `Lint` job on every PR; see `test_cache_ownership.py`.

The same manifest carries the repository's Actions-cache `budget` (soldr#3047):
per-family `key_prefixes` and `max_bytes` allocations, enforced against the live
`gh cache list` by `.github/scripts/check_cache_budget.py` in the `Cache Budget`
workflow. `test_cache_budget.py` covers it, including the RED acceptance
fixture `tests/fixtures/actions-cache/listing-2026-09-01.json` — the real
44.23 GiB / 143-entry snapshot that motivated the gate and must fail it.

## Layout

- `test_setup_soldr_action.py` — exercises `resolve_setup.py` end-to-end
  (cache key shapes, target-cache modes, native-cache policy).
- `test_setup_soldr_*.py` — additional unit tests for each
  `.github/actions/setup-soldr/*.py` helper.
- `test_cli.py`, `test_bootstrap_act_image.py` —
  Python-side glue for CLI smoke tests and the `nektos/act` smoke image.
- `fixtures/` — golden files (e.g. exporter expected outputs).
- `conftest.py` — shared fixtures and path bootstrap.
