"""The cacheability lane's memory-pressure evidence (soldr#2781 / soldr#2817).

`Nextest Cacheability` has failed every run since 2026-08-10, repeatedly with
a compiler killed by a signal, and soldr's own message says only that this
"can indicate an OOM/resource-limit kill". Three separate triages stopped at
"can indicate" -- including one that checked `dmesg` and found nothing, which
is a different question from whether the *cgroup* recorded a kill.

The container's cgroup answers it, and answers it in both directions: cgroup
v2's `memory.events` counts every process in the cgroup killed by any OOM
killer, so a zero rules memory out rather than merely failing to confirm it.

These tests cover that reader, and the phase-attribution bug that made the
lane misreport where it died, without needing Docker or the 40-minute run.
