"""soldr#2469 step 2.2: release-auto.yml inline logic shrinks monotonically.

The 0.9.0 incident chain ran through inline YAML no test could exercise.
Step 2.2's end state is release decision/state logic living in unit-tested
scripts; this ratchet is the enforcement half — every change to
release-auto.yml may keep or shrink its inline ``run:`` block footprint,
never grow it. Extraction PRs lower the baseline in the same reviewed diff.

The metric is deliberately dumb: non-empty lines inside ``run: |`` / ``run: >``
blocks. Dumb metrics make bad proxies for quality but excellent ratchets —
there is no way to add an inline branch of release logic without the number
going up.
