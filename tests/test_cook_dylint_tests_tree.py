"""Unit tests for `cook_dylint_tests_tree.py` (soldr#3159, soldr#3460).

Covers the lockfile-closure guard -- `lint_roots`, `dependency_closure`, and
`diverging_closures`. The cook itself is `soldr ci-test`'s `dylint-cook-*`

    They are seven separate cargo workspaces with seven separate lockfiles and

    updated alone. They had: soldr#3159 found twelve shared deps at differing
    versions, `cc` at four of them (1.4.0 / 1.4.1 / 1.4.2 / 1.4.4).

    That costs real build time with no upside. All seven cook into ONE shared
    `target/dylint/tests` tree, so every divergence makes that tree carry an
    extra copy of the same crate -- four `cc`s, two `thiserror`s -- compiled,
    linked and kept on disk because the lockfiles disagreed by accident.

    Calls the script's own `diverging_closures` rather than re-deriving the
    closure here: a test that re-implements what it tests validates a copy and
    cannot catch drift between the two (CLAUDE.md, agent code-smell rule).
