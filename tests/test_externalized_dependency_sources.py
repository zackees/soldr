"""zccache and running-process must stay registry dependencies (soldr#2835).

soldr#2837 replaced the `_vender/zccache` and `_vender/running-process`
submodules with exact crates.io dependencies. The measured effect on the
lockfile:

    before (48ca69f7)   22 packages, every one a LOCAL PATH unit
    after  (f95833af)    3 packages, every one registry-sourced

Nineteen packages left the graph entirely. That is the whole point of the
change: a local path unit is owned by the checkout that contains it, so every
fresh Soldr checkout recompiles it, while a registry package can be shared
across checkouts as an external dependency artifact.

None of that was guarded. A `path = ` dep, a `[patch]` redirect, or a
resubmitted gitlink would put the 19 packages back, and the only symptom would
be a build that got slower -- which no test fails on, and which reads as
ordinary CI noise. `verify_vendor_state.py` does not cover it either: it
enforces vendoring *discipline* when vendoring is active, and is dormant while
it is not.

The checks are deliberately specific to these two dependency families.
`[patch.crates-io]` is still legitimately used for `notify` and
`filetime_creation` (soldr#2406), and `_vender/` still holds the cap-std
family, so a blanket "no path deps" rule would be wrong.
