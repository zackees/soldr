"""The dependency inventory must be a ratchet, in both directions (soldr#2752).

soldr#2752 wants third-party crates behind a `soldr-deps` gateway, enforced by
a manifest rule and a source lint. Its recommendation is to land the manifest
half first, because the expensive half (222 serde container attributes, plus
allowlists for `prost` and `clap`, whose derives hardcode `::prost::` /
`::clap::` paths with no crate override) should only be paid once the boundary
has proven worth maintaining.

What the manifest half buys on its own is that adding a dependency stops being
a line in a file nobody diffs. These tests pin the two properties that makes
true: an unlisted dependency fails, and a listed one that is gone also fails,
so the inventory cannot drift into describing a surface that no longer exists.
