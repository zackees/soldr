"""Unit tests for the cacheability acceptance's phase tracking (soldr#1978 item 4).

The acceptance itself needs Docker and ~40 minutes; these cover the part that
does not -- turning the harness's ``## <name>`` markers into observable,
timed phases. That split is deliberate: the reason item 4 exists is that a
40-minute opaque step is undiagnosable, so the diagnosis machinery must be
verifiable without paying 40 minutes to find out it is wrong.
