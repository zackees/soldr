"""Unit tests for the cacheability harness's miss-reason reporting (soldr#2824).

The acceptance needs Docker and ~40 minutes; this covers the part that does
not. The split matters more here than usual, because the thing under test *is*
the diagnosis machinery -- and its predecessor shipped broken precisely because
nobody could afford 40 minutes to find out that the group it printed was empty.

soldr#2825 added the list of units that missed and closed it with the line
"the per-unit reason is in the compile journal named above". No journal was
named anywhere in the harness, so that pointed at nothing, and the Actions
group under it contained only its own header. The reason was never missing --
`soldr cache report --json` already carried the journal path, zccache's
analysis of it, the staged counters and any diagnoses. The harness captured the
whole report and read four integers out of it.

The fixtures below mirror a real `soldr cache report --json`, checked against
live output rather than written from the struct definition.
