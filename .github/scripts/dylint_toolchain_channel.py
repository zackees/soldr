"""Resolve the Dylint nightly channel + pinned Dylint version for CI caching.

soldr#2349 adds three cache keys to `_build-and-test.yml` that all need to
agree on the exact Dylint nightly (`dylints/*/rust-toolchain.toml`'s
`[toolchain].channel`, e.g. `nightly-2026-05-28`) and the exact cargo-dylint
release (`known_tools.rs`'s `pinned_version`, e.g. `6.0.3`):

* the new `~/.rustup/toolchains/<channel>-<host>` cache,
* the dylint driver + prepared-plan-marker cache, and
* the `dylint-toolchain:` / `cargo-dylint-version:` / `dylint-link-version:`
  inputs already passed to `setup-soldr`.

CLAUDE.md is explicit that this value must never be hard-coded a second time:
"The Dylint nightly is declared by the lint libraries, never derived"
(soldr#2945) -- soldr used to derive it from the stable channel and shipped
broken on every host while CI stayed green, because nothing in CI actually ran
`soldr dylint`. A workflow YAML literal that silently drifted from the
libraries would be the exact same failure shape one level up the stack: CI
would keep restoring/installing whatever nightly this file names, the
`ci-test` Dylint plan would resolve a *different* one from the libraries
themselves, and the cache/pre-install would simply go to waste every run
without ever turning red.

This is a thin CLI wrapper around `check_dylint_driver_assets.library_nightly`
/ `pinned_dylint_version` -- those two functions already implement "read the
libraries, verify they agree, canonicalize" and "read known_tools.rs, verify
the two Dylint crate pins agree". Reusing them (rather than re-parsing the
same files a second way) is what CLAUDE.md's "N implementations of one idea"
rule is asking for.

Emits `channel` and `dylint_version` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (for a step with an
`id:`) and to `$GITHUB_ENV` (for later steps that prefer an env var), when
those files are set. Always prints both to stdout, so it is runnable locally
with neither set.
