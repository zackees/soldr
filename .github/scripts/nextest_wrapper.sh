# Nextest run-wrapper entry point (soldr#3453, soldr#3454).
#
# Every Unix test runs through the native `soldr-nextest-wrapper`
# (crates/soldr-nextest-wrapper), the one implementation of the wrapper
# contract. This shim only finds it, by one rule:
#
#   1. $SOLDR_NEXTEST_NATIVE_WRAPPER, when set (an explicit override; the
#      black-box suites use their own SOLDR_NEXTEST_WRAPPER_UNDER_TEST);
#   2. otherwise beside the test binary's Cargo profile directory:
#      `<target>/[<triple>/]<profile>/deps/<test>` ->
#      `<target>/[<triple>/]<profile>/soldr-nextest-wrapper`. The first
#      argument under a `deps/` directory is the test binary, even when a
#      target runner precedes it. A `--workspace` build puts the wrapper
#      there, and `nextest archive` ships it at the same relative path as a
#      non-test binary, so ci-test and extracted archives (target-run lanes,
#      the macOS Recovery replay) need nothing more;
#   3. a scoped run (`nextest run -p soldr-cli ...`) never builds the
#      wrapper's package, so on a miss the first test builds it, once, into
#      exactly that directory: profile and triple come from the same path
#      (`debug` is Cargo's `test` profile; a triple-shaped directory under a
#      visible Cargo target root is a `--target` triple), and the build uses
#      the run's own Cargo (`$CARGO`, never a bare `cargo`; soldr#2878) under
#      an atomic mkdir lock so concurrent first tests wait for one build.
#      Nextest setup scripts cannot do this: they are given no target dir,
#      Cargo profile or triple (nextest 0.9.140), which only this path names;
#   4. otherwise -- no `deps/` path, no `$CARGO` (an archive host, where
#      Cargo is absent and a build must not be attempted), or a failed build
#      -- refuse, loudly: a test never runs unwrapped.
#
# POSIX sh and parameter expansion only -- no dirname, flock or python3: the
# macOS Recovery guest has none of them guaranteed.
#
# zackees/ci.yml#168 (GATE-005), soldr#3516: soldr's tests start soldr
# daemons and touch soldr state roots, so they never run on a developer host
# -- a leaked fixture daemon once claimed the real ~/.soldr root and wedged
# every soldr build on the machine. Every Unix test process passes through
# here, so this is where the suite refuses. CI=true covers GitHub runners and
# act; SOLDR_TEST_ISOLATED=1 is set only by isolated environments (the bosn
# image, the macOS Recovery guest).
