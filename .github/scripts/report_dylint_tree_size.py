"""Report the on-disk size of the Dylint target trees, and which cache
layers served this run vs. rebuilt from scratch.

soldr#2996 Phase 6 proposes persisting `target/dylint/` as a
`dylint-foundation`-tier cache entry, because it is the only mechanism that
can reach the 638s Dylint block: `Swatinem/rust-cache` deletes those trees at
save time, and `dylint_cook_acceptance.py` shows a per-unit object cache alone
still misses (`object_cache_only: miss`) while a restored tarball skips
(`warm_restored_target: skip`).

That proposal is gated on a number nobody has: how big the trees actually are.
The directive in soldr#2996 admits at most one cache family beyond `soldr
cook`, against a 5 GB budget, so a carve-out has to be costed before it is
granted -- not after.

This reports the three trees separately, because they are not
interchangeable. `soldr dylint cook` prewarms the analysis tree
(`--tree analysis`, the default) and, since soldr#3042, the third-party
dependency layer of the UI-test tree (`--tree tests`). It does not prewarm
`libraries/`, nor the linked UI-test products inside `tests/` -- those are
tier 3 and stay cold by design.

Reports, never fails: a missing tree is information (the stage did not run),
not an error, and this must never be the reason a lane goes red.

## soldr#2349 -- cache layer status

`_build-and-test.yml` now restores four separate Dylint-related cache layers
(the dylint nightly toolchain, the libraries+target trees this docstring was
originally about, the dylint driver + prepared-plan marker, plus the existing
rustup 1.95.0 cache). Whether each one actually served a hit or forced a
rebuild is the entire point of adding them -- a cache block nobody can see the
hit/miss status of cannot demonstrate "dylint is fast".

`crates/soldr-cli/src/ci_test/dylint_library_marker.rs` lands the per-library
"this Dylint library build was skipped, not just its target tree restored"
signal: `.soldr-dylint-library-marker-v1.json` next to the built libraries
(`<target>/dylint/libraries/<nightly>-<host>/`), rewritten by `record()` only
when the six `dylint-library-*` stages actually ran (a skip leaves it
untouched). Presence alone therefore never distinguishes skip from rebuilt --
cache-restore already put a marker on disk before `ci-test` runs at all, and a
rebuild rewrites the same filename. What distinguishes them is whether the
file's mtime *changed* across the `ci-test` step, so this script runs in two
modes:

* `--snapshot-library-marker PATH` (run once, before `ci-test`): prints and
  emits `state=absent` or `state=mtime:<st_mtime_ns>` and exits without
  producing the tree-size report. Its `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` value is threaded
  through to the second call.
* `--library-stage-skip-marker PATH --library-stage-skip-marker-before STATE`
  (run once, after `ci-test`, alongside the normal tree-size report): compares
  the marker's current state against the snapshotted `STATE` and reports
  skipped / rebuilt / did-not-run accordingly.

`--cache-hit LABEL=VALUE` (repeatable) prints one additional row per
`actions/cache`-restored Dylint layer (the dylint nightly toolchain, the
libraries+target trees, the dylint driver + prepared-plan marker, plus the
existing rustup 1.95.0 cache), using each step's own `cache-hit` output. A
cache block nobody can see the hit/miss status of cannot demonstrate "dylint
is fast".
