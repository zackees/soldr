"""Every triple soldr ships must have a published Dylint driver (soldr#2945).

## The failure this prevents

Soldr fetches a **prebuilt** `dylint-driver` and refuses to build one from
source (binary-or-exit, soldr#2432/#2484). The driver asset is keyed on two
pins that live in two different files:

* the **Dylint version**, pinned on the `cargo-dylint` / `dylint-link` entries
  in `crates/soldr-fetch/src/fetch/known_tools.rs`;
* the **nightly**, declared by the lint libraries themselves — every
  `dylints/*/rust-toolchain.toml` `[toolchain].channel`.

soldr#2945 fixed *which* nightly soldr asks for: it used to derive one from the
stable channel, and the derived `nightly-2026-02-28` had no driver published
anywhere while the libraries' `nightly-2026-05-28` had one for all eight
release-included triples. The libraries are now the authority.

That fix makes the libraries authoritative but leaves them **unchecked**.
Editing a `dylints/*/rust-toolchain.toml` to a nightly nobody built a driver
for compiles, tests, lints and merges perfectly happily — and then Dylint is
broken on every host, silently, until somebody actually runs it. The signal
only exists at fetch time, on a machine, after the pin is already on `main`.

## What is checked

For **every** release-included canonical triple in `ci/canonical-targets.json`
(the same `release.status == "included"` selection
`.github/scripts/release_completeness.py::included_triples` uses for release
staging), the published soldr-toolchain catalogue must carry exactly one row
whose asset filename is the exact driver identity

    dylint-driver-<version>-<nightly>-<triple>.tar.gz

built the way `soldr-fetch`'s `toolchain_packaged::asset_name` builds it, and
that row must satisfy the Rust runtime's v2 transport union — exactly one of
`urls` / `parts`, a safe filename, and a valid SHA-256 pin. Checking only the
host triple would let a Windows-only or musl-only gap through, which is exactly
the shape of gap soldr#2945 was about.

## Network policy

An unreachable catalogue is **not** a failure. This guard runs on every PR,
and failing them all on a GitHub Pages blip would train people to ignore it.
A fetched catalogue
that is missing a driver *is* a failure — that is the defect, and it is not
transient.
