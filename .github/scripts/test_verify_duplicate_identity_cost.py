"""Tests for the soldr#3045 duplicate-identity cost verifier.

soldr#3045 phase 1 step 0 asks one question before any optimization work
happens: is the observed 525x duplicate `cc` compiler identity in a real
journal actually 525 real per-file compiles, or is most of it cc-rs running
its own compiler-capability probes (`-dM -E`, `-Wa,--help -c`, `--version`,
`-E -`) under the same `context_key`? `verify_duplicate_identity_cost.py`
(T1) answers that from a compile-journal, and this file pins its contract.

The fixtures below build real zccache `JournalEntry` records -- one JSON
object per line, the same shape `analyze_compile_journal.py` already
consumes (`record_from_json`, `_interval`, `_classify_duplicate`,
`NATIVE_SRC_EXTS` are the schema authority; see that module's docstring).
`ts` is the record-WRITE time, i.e. the END of the compile, so every
record's interval is derived as `[ts_ns - latency_ns, ts_ns]`: two records
overlap when their `ts` values sit close together and their `latency_ns`
values are long enough to span each other, and are sequential when their
`ts` values are separated by more than either latency.

If a test here disagrees with the tool once T1 lands,
`analyze_compile_journal.py` is the authority for record semantics -- fix
the assertion only if reading that module shows the fixture, not the tool,
got the schema wrong.
