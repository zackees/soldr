"""ci.toml's `[cache.family]` declarations, as the budget the janitor enforces.

soldr#3618: `ci.toml` is the ONE place a cache family's key prefix and size
are declared. ci-lint reads it directly; `check_cache_budget.py` (the janitor
that deletes, and the budget verdict), `check_cache_ownership.py` (R6/R7),
`windows_guest_probe.py` and `measure_zccache_working_set.py` read it through
this module, so no second copy of a per-family byte number exists.

What `ci/cache-ownership.json` still contributes is not a size. Its
`family_groups` object maps every ci.toml family onto exactly one ownership
group, and per group records:

* `ci_toml_families` -- the member families (each must exist in ci.toml, and
  every ci.toml family must be a member of exactly one group);
* `entries` / `reserved` / `rationale` -- the ownership claims R7 checks;
* `evict` -- the janitor's eviction policy (`lru`, `newest`,
  `newest-per-lineage`, or absent for "never evict for budget"). ci.toml's
  own `evict` only accepts `"lru"`, so the policies this janitor needs beyond
  it cannot be spelled there;
* `store_cap_bytes` (zccache-unit only) -- the ON-DISK trim cap of the
  zccache store, a different quantity from its compressed Actions footprint.

`compose_budget` returns the janitor's historical `budget` shape: a group's
`key_prefixes` are its members' prefixes and its `max_bytes` is the SUM of
its members' footprints, computed exactly as ci-lint's CACHE-004 computes a
family footprint (`max x cardinality(per)`, or the sum of `shapes`).
`total_max_bytes` is the sum over all families and `fail_total_bytes` is
`[cache].budget`.

Standard library only (`tomllib`, Python >= 3.11): ci-pre.yml runs the
janitor with the runner image's own `python3`.
