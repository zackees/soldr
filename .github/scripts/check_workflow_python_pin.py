"""Every workflow job that runs a repo Python script must pin its interpreter.

soldr#2763. The v0.9.3 release died on macOS ARM64 with::

    AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'hardlink_to'

`Path.hardlink_to` is 3.10+. The job ran `.github/scripts/*.py` under whatever
`python3` the runner image happened to ship, and that image's was older. The
call site had been extracted from inline YAML one PR earlier, so this was its
first execution on that lane -- the interpreter floor had been a per-file
convention all along, and nothing was checking it.

An audit at the time found a second landmine already in place
(`validate_npm_release_recovery.py` importing `tomllib`, 3.11+, unguarded), which
is what makes this a class rather than an incident: fixing the one API that blew
up means re-dispatching the release and dying at the next one a cycle later.

## What is checked

For each job in `.github/workflows/*.yml`: if any step's `run:` invokes a script
under `.github/scripts/` or `ci/`, the job must pin the interpreter that runs
it. See `job_pins_interpreter` for what counts -- in particular, setting up uv
and then calling bare `python3` does *not*, which is a distinction two jobs in
this repo were already on the wrong side of.

## Why a ratchet, and not a threshold

Eighteen jobs are unpinned today. soldr#2763 converts them in slices; the
    four acceptance lanes left this list together because they share a
    shape: one stdlib-only repo script, invoked once, with no other Python
    in the job. Failing all
of them at once would block every PR on a sweep through lanes that cannot be
validated locally, so those jobs are baselined in `BASELINE` below: they may
stay as they are, but no *new* unpinned job may appear. Same bargain
`loc_ratchet.py` strikes, and for the same reason -- "don't make it worse" beats
"fix it before you may proceed" when the fix is a wide, hard-to-test sweep.

The baseline fails in **both** directions, like `check_dependency_inventory.py`:
a job that gets pinned must be removed from the list. Otherwise the list rots
into a permanent record of a problem that was quietly solved, and the next
reader cannot tell which entries are real.
