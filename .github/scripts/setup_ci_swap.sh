# Enlarge swap on GitHub-hosted Linux runners to absorb transient LLVM/LTO
# memory peaks during all-miss cross-compiles (soldr#2453).
#
# The 4-vCPU ubuntu-24.04 image ships ~16 GB RAM and only a ~4 GB swapfile.
# A cold `codegen-units=1` thin-LTO build of the daemon crates
# (`zccache-daemon-core`, `soldr-daemon`) plus the resident embedded-zccache
# daemon can momentarily exceed that ceiling and get OOM-killed. The kill
# surfaces as "compiler process was terminated by a Unix signal" and has
# moved between unrelated crates run-to-run — the signature of memory
# pressure, not a compile error.
#
# Bounding Cargo's producer queue (CARGO_BUILD_JOBS) and zccache's admission
# gate (SOLDR_JOBS) reduced the failure rate but did not eliminate it: the
# floor is a single memory-heavy rustc/LLVM child colliding with the daemon's
# resident state. Adding a large swapfile gives that transient peak somewhere
# to spill instead of tripping the OOM killer.
#
# Swap is a safety valve, not a hot path: with a low swappiness the kernel
# keeps working pages in RAM and only touches swap under genuine pressure, so
# the common (fits-in-RAM) case is unaffected while the pathological peak no
# longer kills the build.

# Preflight, because swap is OOM *headroom* and not a correctness requirement.
# Enabling swap needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN *and* a backing file on a filesystem the
# kernel can swap to. An unprivileged container (`act`, a `container:` job,
# some self-hosted setups) fails the first with EPERM; an overlayfs /mnt fails
# the second with EINVAL even under `--privileged`. A capability-bit sniff
# would pass the second case and then blow up on the real allocation, so probe
# instead: a 1 MiB file answers both questions in milliseconds and costs
# nothing when the answer is yes. Before this, `swapon` running under
# `set -euo pipefail` with no `|| true` aborted the whole job on any host that
# could not swap -- a build that would otherwise have succeeded.
