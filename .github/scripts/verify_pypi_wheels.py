"""Wait for a release's full wheel set to become visible on PyPI.

The PyPI half of the release completeness gate, extracted from
release-auto.yml (soldr#2469 step 2.2). PyPI's JSON index is
read-through-cached and lags an upload by seconds to minutes, so npm must not
publish until the wheels are actually resolvable -- otherwise a user's first
`pip install soldr==X.Y.Z` can miss its platform wheel and a resolver caches
the "no compatible wheel" result.

Two things change in the move out of YAML.

**The expected set comes from the contract, not a literal.** The inline block
carried `expected=8` with a comment explaining which matrix rows it counted.
Step 2.1's whole point is that the target contract is the single source, so
this asks `release_completeness` instead; adding or removing a target updates
the gate for free.

**Filenames are checked, not just the count.** The inline block compared
`len(urls)` against 8, so eight *wrong* wheels satisfied it. That is the
0.9.0 failure class -- PR #2455 shrank the matrix, the canonical targets, the
npm selector, and the tests together, and nothing noticed five targets
vanishing because every consumer agreed with the smaller number. Comparing
names against the contract is what makes the gate independent of the thing it
is checking.
