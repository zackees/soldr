"""Keep the per-PR glibc ceilings in agreement (soldr#2145).

Three workflow steps assert the glibc floor of a binary **soldr itself
builds**, and they must agree — they are three measurements of one fact:

  _ci-cross-build-linux.yml        aarch64 cross-build, debug profile
  cross-compile-all-targets.yml    x86_64 host-native, release profile
  cross-compile-all-targets.yml    aarch64 cross-build, release profile

They arrived in three separate PRs (#2145's lane, then soldr#2163, then
soldr#2165) and nothing tied them together, so one could be tightened or
loosened alone and the others would keep reporting the old number.

`release-auto.yml` has **two** ceilings, and excluding the whole file
(as this script used to) silently dropped one of them:

  :902  the *bundled* archive — `soldr`, `soldr-daemon`, `crgx`,
        `cargo-chef`. `crgx` and `cargo-chef` are fetched prebuilt from
        the soldr-toolchain catalogue, and the published v0.8.30 bundle
        measures both at 2.39, so this ceiling is pinned by third-party
        build choices. soldr#2170 tried to lower it and was closed for
        exactly this. Genuinely out of scope.

  :499  `target/<triple>/release/<binary>` — **soldr's own build**, the
        same fact the three per-PR ceilings measure. It is not out of
        scope, it just disagrees: 2.39 against their 2.28.

That disagreement is real and currently intended: soldr#2145 sequences
lowering it *after* a release run confirms the number, because a wrong
guess fails a release rather than a PR. But "intended" and "invisible"
are different things — the old exclusion meant nothing would notice if
it drifted further, or if it were lowered and silently reverted. So it
is asserted here against an explicit expected value instead.

When a release confirms 2.28, lower it in the workflow and update
`RELEASE_OWN_BINARY_CEILING` to match; this check then guards it the
same way it guards the other three.

`verify_wheel_glibc.py` is a different script against different
artifacts (manylinux wheels, 2.17) and is out of scope.

Usage:
  python3 .github/scripts/check_glibc_ceilings.py [--repo-root PATH]

Exit codes:
  0 — every own-binary ceiling agrees
  1 — they disagree, or an expected invocation vanished
