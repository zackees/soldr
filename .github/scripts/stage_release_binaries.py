"""Stage Soldr's executable and debug sidecars for a release archive.

This is the release workflow's narrow packaging boundary: it copies the built
``soldr`` executable to ``dist/package``, creates the ``soldr-daemon``
sidecar, and (Windows only) stages the required PDB. ``package_dir`` is
exactly what ``release_manifest.py`` and the main ``.tar.zst`` archive step
consume, so a missing Windows PDB must fail here.

soldr#3038: Linux debug info and macOS ``.dSYM`` sidecars are staged by
:func:`stage_debug_symbols` into a SEPARATE directory, never into
``package_dir``. That tree is what ``release_manifest.py::collect_debug_info``
reads for ``soldr.debug_info``, and every ``setup-soldr`` consumer runs
``.github/actions/setup-soldr/zccache_contract.py::validate_release_manifest``
against that field, which hard-rejects any entry whose ``format`` is not
``"pdb"``. See ``docs/DEBUG_SIDECARS.md`` for the resulting contract: symbols
ship as their own opt-in ``-symbols.tar.zst`` release asset that
``setup-soldr`` never downloads or parses.

soldr#3038 also replaced rustc's ``split-debuginfo = "packed"`` with a
post-link ``objcopy``/``strip`` carve-out for Linux (both gnu and musl):
"packed" only captures DWARF for the crates rustc itself compiles in this
build, not the precompiled std or the C dependencies built through the `cc`
crate (`ring`, `zstd-sys`, `lzma-sys`, `libsqlite3-sys`, mimalloc-pprof),
which embed their own DWARF in the final link regardless of that setting. The
result was duplication, not splitting: soldr's shipped binary went 21.3 MiB
(stripped) -> 73.8 MiB ("packed") while the `.dwp` beside it held another
48.5 MiB. Running `objcopy --only-keep-debug` on the fully linked binary
after the fact captures every source of DWARF in one pass with nothing left
behind. macOS keeps `split-debuginfo = "packed"` (dsymutil's `.dSYM` model
does not have this duplication problem) with a `strip -x` pass afterward;
Windows is unaffected (MSVC already emits a separate, required PDB).

soldr#3085: the objcopy/strip pass above must use binutils that can read what
the lane just BUILT, not what the lane happens to RUN ON. Most of the release
matrix cross-builds on an x86_64 Linux runner, where the host's GNU binutils
rejects a foreign-arch ELF and cannot read Mach-O at all -- that is what broke
three lanes of release run 33820395040. `select_binutils` therefore keeps host
GNU binutils only for a host-native target and reaches for target-agnostic
`llvm-objcopy` / `llvm-strip` (or the managed cross toolchain's
target-prefixed binutils) otherwise. See that function for the full rationale.

It was extracted from release-auto.yml as part of soldr#2469 step 2.2 so the
platform-specific staging policy can be unit-tested without running a release.

Usage (CI):
    python3 .github/scripts/stage_release_binaries.py \
        --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --package-dir dist/package \
        --symbols-dir dist/symbols

# Cross-target binutils selection (soldr#3085)
#
# soldr#3038 (landed as 6f5b0f1b, after v0.9.11 was cut) made this script run
# `objcopy`/`strip` over the staged binary. Those bare names resolve to the
# HOST's GNU binutils, and half the release matrix cross-builds on an x86_64
# Linux runner:
#
#   * `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` has ALWAYS been an x86_64-hosted cross lane.
#     Ubuntu's stock binutils is single-target, so it rejects the aarch64 ELF:
#     "objcopy: Unable to recognise the format of the input file".
#   * `*-apple-darwin` moved from macOS runners to Linux ones in soldr#3073.
#     GNU binutils cannot read Mach-O at ALL, at any architecture:
#     "strip: dist/package/soldr: file format not recognized".
#
# Both were observed in release run 33820395040 (v0.9.12) and both are
# reproducible locally against a clang-built aarch64 ELF / arm64 Mach-O.
#
# The fix is to pick a tool that can read what this lane just BUILT rather
# than what this lane happens to RUN ON. `llvm-objcopy` / `llvm-strip` are
# target-agnostic by construction (one binary, every LLVM object format), so
# they are the first choice for any foreign target; they implement the exact
# GNU options this carve-out uses ("compatible with GNU objcopy"), including
# `--add-gnu-debuglink` and Mach-O `-x`. Host GNU binutils is still used
# verbatim when the target IS the host, so the lanes that work today keep
# byte-for-byte the same tooling.
