"""Fail CI when the repository's GitHub Actions cache exceeds its budget.

soldr#3047, Phase B of soldr#3039. GitHub evicts the oldest, least-recently-used
entries once a repository's Actions cache crosses the 10 GB it documents as the
per-repository ceiling, and it does so silently: no job goes red, the run whose
warm cache disappeared underneath it just gets slower. The manifest's
`budget.total_max_bytes` is 8.5 GiB -- the sum of the family allocations -- and
`budget.fail_total_bytes` is 9.5 GiB (10,200,547,328), a GiB of headroom
so a family briefly over its own allocation does not fail the whole gate
before the next `--prune` sweep catches up. Both numbers live in
`ci/cache-ownership.json`; this script reads them and hard-codes neither.

`zackees/soldr`'s cache had grown to 44.23 GiB across 143 entries by
2026-09-01 (`tests/fixtures/actions-cache/listing-2026-09-01.json`, the RED
acceptance fixture for this guard) -- more than four times the ceiling -- and
nothing in CI could tell a reviewer that from a passing lane. The only signal
was slower builds nobody could attribute to a cause.

## What is checked

`ci/cache-ownership.json` carries a `budget` object: a `total_max_bytes`
allocation, a `fail_total_bytes` hard ceiling, and a `families` map. Each
family declares the `key_prefixes` it owns, a `max_bytes` allocation, and a
rationale. Every live cache entry is assigned to the family whose
`key_prefixes` entry is the LONGEST match on that entry's key -- longest,
so a family that owns a specific sub-namespace is not shadowed by a sibling
family's shorter, more general prefix.

Three things fail the gate:

* **An unregistered key.** An entry matching no family's `key_prefixes` names
  a producer nobody declared. The manifest is authoritative, not descriptive:
  a new cache-writing step must register its prefix in the same PR that adds
  it, or this guard has no way to tell a reviewed addition from cache-key
  drift (a resurrected `v0-rust-cross-build-*` key, say).
* **A family over its allocation.** Bytes used under one family's prefixes
  exceed that family's declared `max_bytes`.
* **The total over `fail_total_bytes`.** Even when every family individually
  fits, the sum across all of them may not exceed the hard ceiling.

## Network policy

By default, SKIP, DO NOT FAIL, when the live source is unavailable: `gh`
missing, a non-zero exit, or a response that does not parse as JSON. This
keeps fork PRs with read-only/no tokens from going red for lack of API access.
The same-repository PR budget gate and main operational sweep pass
`--require-live`, so those required paths fail closed instead of showing a
false green. `--from-json` bypasses the network entirely (used for the
acceptance fixture) and its own read failures are real failures, not skips,
because the caller chose that exact path.

## Pruning

`--prune` lists (never deletes without `--apply`) safe classes of
reclaimable entry: keys under a `RETIRED_PREFIXES` namespace whose producer no
longer runs, entries on a ref other than `refs/heads/main` (a PR's caches are
never restored by another PR), and `v0-rust-*` entries on `refs/heads/main`
that have been superseded by a newer generation of the same shared-key
lineage. The old perf-matrix target-cache namespace is an exception: it is
kept until a registry-only replacement exists for the same platform. It also
retires old cook locks within the same target/feature shape
(across soldr versions) only when that shape has a base under the exact
current main Cargo.lock hash; see `cook_lineage_candidates`, and superseded
setup-action store generations (an older lock, or an older toolchain hash
than the platform's newest current-lock store) via
`action_store_lineage_candidates`. The report
prints raw usage and the projected effective-after-safe-prune usage
separately, and the exit code always follows raw usage.
Pruning needs cache ids to call `gh cache delete`, so it requires the live
source; `--from-json` fixtures carry no ids.

Usage:
    python .github/scripts/check_cache_budget.py [options]
Options:
    --manifest PATH   budget manifest (default: ci/cache-ownership.json)
    --from-json PATH  read a cache listing from this file instead of `gh`
    --repo OWNER/NAME repository to query (default: zackees/soldr)
    --require-live    fail rather than skip when the live cache listing is unavailable
    --prune           report deletion candidates (dry run)
    --apply           with --prune, actually delete the candidates
    --sweep-only      with --prune --apply, exit 0 after deleting (janitor)
    --event-name E    triggering event; decides who pays for an overage
    --ref REF         triggering ref (refs/pull/N/merge for a PR)
    --delete-ref REF  delete one closed PR's entries, then exit 0

## Convergence and enforcement (zackees/ci.yml#6 "Cache (live)", GEN-009)

The janitor (`--prune --apply --sweep-only`, run by `ci-pre.yml` before every
CI run and on a schedule) deletes, in order: every safe-prune candidate --
including every `refs/pull/*` entry, which no other ref can restore -- and
then, per family, whatever its declared `evict` policy (`lru`,
`newest-per-lineage`) needs to fit its allocation. Families without `evict`
are never evicted for budget. Nothing younger than `SWEEP_GRACE_SECONDS` is
deleted. See `plan_sweep`.

The verdict depends on the event (`enforcement_mode`): a pull request fails
only for entries it saved from its own ref or for a static manifest breach
(`forecast_problems`), and warns about everything else; a push to a branch
other than main warns; main, schedule, dispatch and local runs fail hard.
