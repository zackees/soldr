"""Report free disk space on the volumes a target-run shard consumes.

soldr#2734: a windows-gnu shard exhausted the runner disk and three tests
died on a raw ``Os { code: 112, kind: StorageFull }`` from inside
``isolated_daemon.rs``. Nothing in the job output said how much disk was
left at any point, so the cause could only be inferred backwards from an
OS error three layers from the shard that caused it.

soldr#2699 is why nothing else reports it. That issue set
``SOLDR_TARGET_WARN_FREE_GB`` and ``SOLDR_TARGET_BLOCK_FREE_GB`` equal at
1 GiB on this lane, deliberately, so soldr's watchdog never enters its
warn-tier auto-prune path -- pruning mid-run could delete a concurrently
executing test's target tree. The trade-off is that soldr stays silent
until 1 GiB, by which point the runner is effectively out.

This closes that observability gap without touching the thresholds:
print a reading, before and after the archive run, and let a future
exhaustion be diagnosed forwards.

**This is a diagnostic and must never fail the lane.** An unreadable
path is reported and skipped; the exit code is always 0. A disk report
that can turn a green run red is worse than no disk report.
