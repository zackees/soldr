"""Verify that every job which allocates a runner has a bounded runtime.

soldr#1978 item 8. This used to check `ci.yml` alone, which left the two jobs
that run on *every* PR -- `_build-and-test.yml` and `_bootstrap-e2e.yml` --
sitting on GitHub's 360-minute default until soldr#1977 added timeouts by hand.

The per-job rule was already right: a job with `runs-on` needs a timeout, and a
reusable-workflow *caller* (`uses:` with no `runs-on`) cannot have one. What was
missing is that the reusable workflow *files themselves* contain jobs with
`runs-on`, and nothing ever opened them. Walking the whole directory makes the
regression class impossible rather than fixed-once.

# Workflows that predate this check and still have unbounded jobs.
#
# soldr#1978 item 8: extending the walk to every workflow surfaced a set of
# jobs sitting on GitHub's 360-minute default. They are recorded rather than
# silently skipped, and rather than blocked -- the same trade `loc_ratchet`
# makes for the files already over the line ceiling. The live count is printed
# by `main()` on every run, so it is deliberately not repeated here: a number
# in a comment goes stale the first time someone burns an entry down, which is
# exactly what happened after the first three.
#
# Burned down so far: benchmark-stats (#2057), parent-cache-bench (#2058),
# cache-delta-experiment (#2067), release-auto + vcpkg-windows-refresh (#2077).
#
# The point of the extension is that a *new* workflow cannot join this list.
# Removing an entry is a burn-down PR; picking the right bound for a perf or
# release job needs someone who knows how long it legitimately runs, and a
# too-low timeout that kills a healthy long build is worse than the default.
# `test_grandfathered_entries_still_need_the_exemption` fails if every job in a
# listed file has since been bounded, so a spent entry cannot linger.
#
# The list is now empty. The last two entries were held for *evidence*, not
# effort: bounds for the burned-down files came from measured job history, and
# an earlier pass found none for these two. Widening the sample to 20 runs
# changed that for `perf-matrix` -- real cells have since run, not just the
# `gate` job:
#
#   build-soldr  max  6.0 min      bench  max  4.1 min
#   gate / setup / evaluate  ~0.1 min
#
# so those are bounded from history with 7x or better headroom. Two caveats are
# deliberately reflected in the numbers rather than papered over:
#
#   * Only the `medium` and `sqlite-link` fixtures have ever run. A heavier
#     fixture is legitimately slower, so `bench` is set to 120 -- ~29x the
#     observed max -- rather than something snug.
#   * `perf-cold-warm` still has zero completed runs. Its jobs are bounded by
#     analogy (same ubuntu-24.04 runner, same build work as perf-matrix) and
#     loosely: 90 for the two build jobs.
#
# The original caution stands and is worth restating for whoever edits these
# next: a too-low timeout that kills a healthy long build is worse than the
# 360-minute default. These bounds exist to convert an unbounded hang into a
# bounded failure, not to police perf runtimes. If a legitimate sweep ever
# approaches one of them, raise it -- that is not a regression.
