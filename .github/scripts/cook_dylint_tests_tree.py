"""Lockfile-closure guard for the Dylint UI-test dependency layer (soldr#3159).

`soldr ci-test` cooks the `target/dylint/tests` third-party layer
(`dylint_testing` -> `compiletest_rs` / `git2` / `libgit2-sys`, plus
`dylint`'s own build script) as its `dylint-cook-*` stages (soldr#3460;
before that, this script drove the cook as a serial workflow step,
soldr#3042). All seven lint crates share that one tree, so it only stays one
layer while their lockfiles resolve the same third-party closure. This module
owns that definition; `tests/test_cook_dylint_tests_tree.py` enforces it.
