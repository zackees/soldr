"""Verify whether the 525x duplicate `cc` identity is real work (soldr#3045).

soldr#3045 is step 0 of Phase 1 of zccache in-flight coalescing (child of
soldr#3039, the "measure before you optimize" umbrella). soldr#3039's
baseline table reports 579 of 1,569 compiles as exact-`context_key`
duplicates, all concurrent, 525 of them one `cc` identity compiled under
`-C linker=dylint-link`. The checked-in baseline JSON
(`baselines/compile_journal_baseline_33536940076.json`) pins the 579/0
concurrent/sequential split and carries the `gh run download` line for the
artifact it came from; the 525x `cc` identity is in the issue's table, NOT
in that file -- which is exactly why it has to be re-derived here rather
than quoted. Before building coalescing, this tool answers, from a real
compile journal, the two questions that decide whether that number is worth
building anything for:

    1. Is the 525x duplicate `cc` identity real compilation, or is it cc-rs /
       autoconf-style capability probing (`--version`, `-dM -E`, throwaway
       `conftest.c` files, `/dev/null` targets)? A probe that runs 525 times
       concurrently is still cheap; a real compile that runs 525 times
       concurrently is a genuine coalescing opportunity.
    2. What is the CEILING on what in-flight coalescing could save? For any
       group of duplicate invocations that ran concurrently, at most all but
       one (the "leader") could ever be coalesced away -- so the ceiling per
       identity is `sum(latency) - max(latency)`, never the full sum.

This script does not decide soldr#3045's fate. It computes the numbers and
prints a mechanical verdict from a fixed threshold; closing or continuing a
phase of soldr#3039 is the owner's call (see CLAUDE.md's code-smell rule:
"a design question rather than a typo" needs an owner decision, not a tool).

TWO SCHEMA FACTS THAT BOUND THE ANSWER
    (a) NO CPU-TIME FIELD. `analyze_compile_journal.py` already documents
        that the zccache journal carries no CPU-time field and emits
        `*_cpu_seconds: None`. Every duration this tool prints is WALL
        latency derived from `latency_ns`, never CPU time -- every output
        key here says `wall`, and none says `cpu` next to a number.
    (b) RSS FIELDS ARE DROPPED BY `Record`. `analyze_compile_journal.Record`
        deliberately does not carry `child_peak_rss_bytes` or
        `tree_peak_rss_bytes` (see that module's docstring on optional
        extended fields). Those two fields are the best real-vs-probe memory
        evidence a journal has, so this tool reads the raw JSON object
        itself and keeps `(record, obj)` pairs throughout, rather than
        relying on `Record` alone.

READING INPUT
    Paths are resolved with `analyze_compile_journal.discover_journal_files`.
    Each resolved file is then read line by line, mirroring that module's
    own `_read_journals`: strip, skip blanks, dedupe byte-identical lines
    across ALL files by default, `json.loads`, then
    `record_from_json(obj, str(path))`. A line that fails to parse, or whose
    `record_from_json` returns None, is counted as malformed and skipped --
    never fatal.

    KEEP DEDUPE ON. `--no-dedupe` exists to inspect the raw files, NOT to
    measure duplicates. A `build-logs-*` artifact's
    `cache/zccache/history/<id>/compile_journal.jsonl` files are nested
    SNAPSHOTS of one growing journal -- measured on run 33536940076's
    artifact, the files form a strict-superset chain (424 lines subset-of 454
    subset-of 500), so 2,439 raw lines carry only 1,538 distinct records. With
    dedupe off, every re-snapshotted record becomes a fake "concurrent
    duplicate": this tool then reports 34% coalescable on a journal whose true
    concurrent-duplicate count is ZERO. A record's `ts` is millisecond-stamped,
    so two byte-identical lines are one compile written twice, never two
    compiles.

GROUPING
    Records are grouped by `record.context_key`. A record with a falsy
    `context_key` is excluded from grouping and counted separately as
    `records_without_context_key` (this matches
    `analyze_compile_journal._compute_duplicates`, where ~17% of a real
    journal has no key). Only groups with more than one member, AND with at
    least `--min-count` (default 2) members, are duplicate groups. Duplicate
    groups are sorted by member count descending, tied-break by the
    `context_key` string, and the first `--top N` (default 10) are reported
    in full detail. Every OTHER total in this tool's output (group counts,
    excess records, flavour totals, coalescable-seconds totals) is computed
    over ALL qualifying duplicate groups, not just the reported top N.

CLASSIFIER (`classify_invocation`) -- THE HEART OF THIS TOOL
    Returns "probe" | "real-compile" | "unknown" for one journal invocation.
    Every rule below is evidence-backed: the two argv shapes are literal
    cc-rs / openssl-build capability probes read out of real local journals
    under `~/.soldr/cache/zccache/history`, both recorded against
    `"compiler": "/run/current-system/sw/bin/cc"`:

        ["-dM", "-E", "-x", "c", "/dev/null"]
        ["-Wa,--help", "-c", "-o", "null.3117452.o", "-x", "assembler",
         "/dev/null"]

    Rules, in the order applied:
      * Non-native (a rustc record, `_is_native_compiler` is False) with
        `--crate-name` present -> "real-compile". rustc only sets
        `--crate-name` when it is actually compiling a crate.
      * Native + `/dev/null` in any arg -> "probe" (both examples above).
      * Native + an arg equal to `--version`, `-V`, `--help`, `-dumpmachine`,
        `-dumpversion`, or starting with `-Wa,--help` or `--print`
        -> "probe" (matches example 2's `-Wa,--help`).
      * Native + `-E` or `-dM` present -> "probe" (matches example 1).
      * Native + exactly one source-extension arg (see
        `analyze_compile_journal.NATIVE_SRC_EXTS`) whose basename matches
        `^(null|probe|test|conftest)[-_.0-9]*\\.[A-Za-z+]+$` -> "probe"
        (cc-rs writes throwaway probe files with names of that shape).
      * Native + `-c` present + at least one source-extension arg that is
        neither `/dev/null` nor a throwaway-named file -> "real-compile".
      * Anything else -> "unknown".

    NOT A RULE: latency. A slow probe on a contended runner is still a
    probe, and a fast compile is still a compile. Latency is reported next
    to the classification so a reader can judge it, but it never defines
    the class -- classifying by latency would make a busy CI runner turn
    real compiles into "probes" and vice versa, silently, per run.

OUTPUT SHAPE
    `main`'s summary is `{"totals": {...}, "identities": [...]}`.
    `totals` carries the aggregate counts described above plus three
    savings figures computed over duplicate groups that have at least one
    "concurrent" member (see `analyze_compile_journal._classify_duplicate`):
    `coalescable_wall_seconds_total`, `_probe`, `_real` (bucketed by the
    MAJORITY `classify_invocation` result across that group's members, ties
    broken toward "real-compile" -- see `_group_classification`; "unknown"
    groups land in `coalescable_wall_seconds_unknown`, neither probe nor
    real), and `coalescable_fraction_real` = `coalescable_wall_seconds_real`
    / `total_wall_seconds` (0.0 when the denominator is 0).
    Each entry in `identities` is one reported duplicate group's full detail
    (classification, wall-latency and RSS statistics, coalescable ceiling).

WHAT `total_wall_seconds` IS, AND IS NOT
    It is the SUM of every record's `latency_ns`, i.e. aggregate per-compile
    latency summed across compiles that ran in parallel. It is NOT the
    elapsed wall-clock of the build, and it is always much larger than it on
    an N-way runner. Every ratio in this tool -- including
    `coalescable_fraction_real` and the verdict's percentage -- is therefore
    a fraction of AGGREGATE COMPILE LATENCY. A coalesced second is a second
    of compiler work not done; how much of it reaches the build's elapsed
    time depends on whether that unit was on the critical path, which this
    journal cannot say. Read the percentage as "how much of the compiler
    work is redundant", never as "how much shorter the build gets".

VERDICT
    `verdict(totals)` is mechanical: `coalescable_fraction_real < 0.05` is
    "negligible" (recommend closing soldr#3045, but that call belongs to the
    owner), `>= 0.15` is "proceed", otherwise "need-better-data". The
    rendered sentence always carries the real-compile coalescable seconds,
    the total wall seconds, and the percentage it was computed from.

    ONE OVERRIDE, and it only ever weakens a close: a "negligible" that is
    computed while the UNKNOWN bucket alone is >= 5% of `total_wall_seconds`
    is downgraded to "need-better-data". "Negligible" is the verdict that
    argues for closing soldr#3045, and it is only honest when the work it
    excluded was actually classified. A big unclassified bucket means the
    classifier did not recognise this journal's shapes -- that is a reason
    to teach the classifier, not a reason to close the issue. The override
    can never turn a "proceed" into anything else, so it cannot hide payoff.

EXIT CODE
    Returns 1 when `discover_journal_files` finds no files at all (an
    operator path typo, which must not look like a clean result), and 2 when
    a requested `--json-out` / `--markdown-out` file could not be written.
    The second one matters because `--markdown-out` is the deliverable: the
    documented workflow pipes it straight into `gh issue comment
    --body-file`, so a silently-failed write would post a STALE file left
    over from an earlier run. Every other case -- including a journal with
    zero duplicate groups -- returns 0, because "no duplicates measured" is
    itself a real, reportable answer.

SCOPE: POINT THIS AT ONE RUN'S JOURNAL
    The concurrent/sequential/cross_generation flavour is decided pairwise
    inside each duplicate group (that is what
    `analyze_compile_journal._classify_duplicate` does), so the work is
    quadratic in the largest group. One `ci-test` run's journal has a
    largest group in the hundreds, which is instant. The whole
    `~/.soldr/cache/zccache/history/` tree is thousands of runs' journals
    merged into one grouping, which is both slow AND wrong for this
    question: records from two different runs are not each other's
    in-flight duplicates, and merging them inflates every group. Pass a
    single `history/<id>/` directory, or the journal(s) from one
    `build-logs-*` CI artifact.

USAGE
    python3 .github/scripts/verify_duplicate_identity_cost.py \\
        ~/.soldr/cache/zccache/history/<run-id>/ --top 10 \\
        --markdown-out summary.md

THE ANSWER THIS TOOL PRODUCED (run 33536940076, step 0's deliverable)
    Concurrent exact-`context_key` duplicates: 0. Coalescable real-compile
    wall time: 0.00s of 2442.21s. The 525x `cc` identity is REAL C
    compilation and NOT a duplicate:

      * The number comes from `soldr ci-test`'s compiler-unit report, not
        from this journal. That run's job log reads "1531 executions, 963
        identities, 568 duplicate executions", and its largest duplicate
        identity (`9308d1c2...`, `compiler=/usr/bin/cc`,
        `rustflags=-Clinker=dylint-link`) fired 412 times.
      * Those 412 are 206 distinct libgit2 C sources compiled twice each,
        204.3s aggregate, into two different build-script out-dirs
        (`libgit2-sys-6f2fbc7f71825ed9` vs `libgit2-sys-ac995ae7486d7a10`)
        with different flags (one carries `-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer`),
        ~3.5 minutes apart. All 412 have DISTINCT `context_key`s.
      * They collapse to one identity because
        `soldr-daemon/src/ci_test_report.rs::normalized_identity` is
        rustc-shaped: for a `cc` argv, `--crate-name`, `--crate-type`,
        `--target`, the `.rs` source, `--cfg` and `-C` are all empty, so the
        identity reduces to compiler + `CARGO_FEATURE_*` + RUSTFLAGS + cwd
        and ignores the C file and every cc argument.

    Coalescing keys on `context_key` and only fires for requests that
    overlap in time, so it would have coalesced ZERO of them. The 204.3s is
    real redundant work, but it is a fingerprint/out-dir problem, not an
    in-flight one.
