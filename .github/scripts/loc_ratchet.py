"""Enforce the per-file line ceiling in CI, as a ratchet (soldr#1966).

The 1,500-line ceiling was enforced only by a PostToolUse hook. A hook fires
when an agent edits a file; it does not fire for a human edit, a squash merge,
or anything CI does. So files drifted past the ceiling by every other route,
and the cost landed on whichever agent next had to touch one -- as a hard
block demanding a refactor before an unrelated fix could proceed.

That refactor is a *rename*, and renames conflict destructively: soldr#1962
became a modify/delete conflict against the soldr#1960 split, where resolving
it by taking the delete compiles, passes CI, and silently ships the fix
missing. The biggest files are the popular ones, so the blast radius is
largest exactly where splitting is most dangerous.

A plain threshold in CI cannot be adopted here -- 13 files are already over,
and blocking every PR that touches them would be worse than the status quo.
So this is a **ratchet** rather than a threshold:

* a file at or under the ceiling must stay at or under it;
* a file already over may not get *bigger*;
* shrinking is always allowed.
* Rust `mod.rs` files are exempt because they are module aggregation surfaces
  whose size does not reliably describe a monolithic implementation.

That needs no hand-maintained grandfather list -- the baseline is simply the
file's size at the merge base, which is always correct and never goes stale.
It also puts the cost on the change that causes it, while the diff is small,
instead of on an unrelated change months later.

Usage:
    loc_ratchet.py --base-ref origin/main [--ceiling 1500] [--paths crates]
