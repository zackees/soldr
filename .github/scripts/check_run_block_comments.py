"""Refuse `#` inside a folded (`>`) `run:` block in a workflow.

soldr#3018 found this the expensive way. `ci.yml`'s macOS queue watchdog
carried its rationale as `#` lines *inside* a `run: >-` scalar. In a folded
scalar `#` is not a comment -- it is literal text -- so YAML folded the whole
block onto one line and the shell then treated the first `#` as the start of a
shell comment, discarding everything after it.

What it discarded was `--grace-seconds 2700`. The watchdog silently ran at its
900s argparse default, so a recalibration the file documented in fifteen lines
of prose had never once taken effect. It failed intermittently for as long as
that was true, and every failure looked like the flaky lane it was watching.

A literal `|` block is safe -- newlines survive, so `#` starts a real shell
comment on its own line -- so only folded scalars are rejected. The fix is
always the same: move the prose to a YAML comment above the step.

Usage:
    python3 .github/scripts/check_run_block_comments.py [--workflows DIR]

Exit codes:
  0 - no folded run block contains `#`
  1 - at least one does
