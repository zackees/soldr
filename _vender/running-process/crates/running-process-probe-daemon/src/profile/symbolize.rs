//! Turning instruction pointers into names, off the hot path (S15 / #644).
//!
//! Runs after sampling, never between samples. Parsing PDB/DWARF/Mach-O costs
//! orders of magnitude more than capturing a stack, so doing it inline would
//! make the profiler the dominant entry in its own profile.
//!
//! # It works after the target has exited
//!
//! A raw sample is `(module, relative address)` once the module list is
//! attached. Neither depends on the process still existing, so a profile of a
//! program that crashed mid-session still symbolizes — which is exactly when
//! it is most wanted. This is why the sampler records the module list once, at
//! session start, instead of resolving names as it goes.
