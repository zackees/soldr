//! Off-CPU / async profiling via pluggable adapters (S17b / #647).
//!
//! # Why an adapter contract instead of a tokio integration
//!
//! Off-CPU time is where a program *is not running*: blocked on a lock, a
//! socket, a channel, a scheduler queue. A CPU profile is blind to all of it —
//! a request that took nine seconds waiting and one second computing looks,
//! in a CPU profile, like one second of work.
//!
//! Every runtime exposes that information differently: tokio streams task
//! updates over a gRPC endpoint, asyncio has `all_tasks()`, and an in-house
//! executor has whatever its authors instrumented. Hardwiring one of them
//! would make the other two second-class forever.
//!
//! So the contract is deliberately narrow:
//!
//! > given (source, interval, frequency) → produce a pprof for that window
//!
//! Everything streaming, runtime-specific, or protocol-shaped is contained
//! *inside* an adapter. The daemon only ever sees a pprof. That is the same
//! model Go uses for its block and mutex profiles, and it is why this rides
//! the existing pipeline (S15/S16) without a single format-specific branch in
//! the flame graph.
//!
//! # Default-off, and bounded like everything else
//!
//! An adapter subscribes to a debugging endpoint the application had to opt
//! into exposing. The window is capped at the same 60 seconds as CPU
//! profiling, for the same reason: a session an operator can start and forget
//! is one that degrades a production process indefinitely.
