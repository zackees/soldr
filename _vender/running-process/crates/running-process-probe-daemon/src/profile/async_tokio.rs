//! The live `console-api` subscription behind [`TokioAdapter`] (#788).
//!
//! # Why this is a separate module
//!
//! `async_profile` is the contract: `TaskSample`, the adapter trait, the pprof
//! lowering. It is deliberately free of any runtime's vocabulary. Everything
//! gRPC-shaped lives here, so the claim "nothing downstream is tokio-shaped"
//! stays checkable by looking at what this file exports — one function
//! returning `Vec<TaskSample>`.
//!
//! # What it collects
//!
//! `console-subscriber` serves a stream of `InstrumentUpdate`. The first
//! message carries the tasks that already exist; later ones carry new tasks
//! and updated per-task stats. Stats are cumulative, not deltas, so the last
//! observation of each task wins and the window is simply how long we listen.
//!
//! # Idle time is derived, not reported
//!
//! console-api reports `busy_time` and `scheduled_time`, plus the timestamps
//! bounding a task's life. Idle is what is left:
//!
//! ```text
//! idle = (dropped_at | now) - created_at - busy_time - scheduled_time
//! ```
//!
//! Clamped at zero, because the three components are sampled at slightly
//! different instants and a task polled right as the window closed can
//! otherwise produce a small negative.
//!
