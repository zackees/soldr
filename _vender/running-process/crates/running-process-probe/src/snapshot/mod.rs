//! Cooperative all-thread stack capture (#635, S6).
//!
//! # Cooperative, not external
//!
//! The probe thread lives *inside* the target process and walks its own
//! sibling threads. There is no ptrace, no debugger attach, and no OS
//! capability grant — those belong to the later `--force` external tier.
//!
//! # The suspend window is the whole design
//!
//! A suspended thread may hold *any* lock, including the allocator's. So while
//! a thread is suspended this code does exactly two things: read its registers
//! and `memcpy` a bounded slice of its stack into a **preallocated** buffer.
//! Then it resumes immediately.
//!
//! Nothing else happens in that window — no allocation, no symbolization, no
//! logging, no lock acquisition. Unwinding and symbolization run afterward,
//! against the copied bytes, when every thread is running again. Violating
//! this is how a stack profiler deadlocks the process it is profiling: suspend
//! a thread inside `malloc`, then call `malloc` yourself.
//!
//! Windows, Linux, and macOS capture x86_64/aarch64 sibling stacks. Each
//! backend resumes before deferred PE/ELF/Mach-O unwinding. Other platforms
//! return [`SnapshotError::Unsupported`] rather than an empty snapshot.

// Both Windows architectures are supported. The register names and the
// unwinder differ per arch (see `windows.rs` / `unwind.rs`); everything else --
// enumeration, suspend/resume sequencing, stack-copy bounds -- is shared.
// Attribution needs a per-object-format module inventory.
