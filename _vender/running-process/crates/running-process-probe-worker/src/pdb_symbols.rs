//! Resolving addresses to function names from a PDB (#637).
//!
//! # Why a sorted table rather than a lookup per address
//!
//! PDB symbols carry a start address but no length, so the function
//! containing an address is the one with the greatest start not exceeding it.
//! That needs the symbols ordered, and a capture has many addresses in the
//! same module — building the table once and binary-searching it turns a
//! repeated linear scan of every symbol into one sort.
//!
//! # Nothing is guessed
//!
//! An address below the first symbol resolves to nothing rather than to the
//! first function. A missing or unreadable PDB yields no map at all. Every one
//! of those paths leaves the frame with its module and offset and a status
//! saying resolution did not happen — a wrong function name would send whoever
//! reads the report somewhere else entirely, and nothing in the output would
//! contradict them.
