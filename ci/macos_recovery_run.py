"""Per-PR macOS x86_64 execution lane, hosted in a Recovery guest (soldr#3076/#3078).

`e2e-macos-x64` in `ci.yml` cross-builds `x86_64-apple-darwin` on Linux (via
`_ci-cross-build-linux.yml`) and replays the packaged nextest archive inside a
`zackees/docker-mac-x64` Recovery guest -- a real x86_64 macOS **Recovery**
guest, no baked image, no secret, no ssh (soldr#3076). Recovery boots fresh
per action invocation, runs exactly one script (typed into a GUI Terminal and
fetched back over HTTP), and `/tmp` is a ramdisk that nothing survives past
that one boot. There is no toolchain to provision ahead of time and no room
for the decompressed nextest archive on the ramdisk -- but Recovery *can*
format and mount the action's blank 64 GB qcow2 disk, which gives the guest
script a real, persistent-for-the-boot volume to extract onto and provision a
managed rustup toolchain under (soldr#3078).

So this lane replays the same positively-owned host-sensitive nextest
partition every other `target-run` lane replays (`_ci-target-run.yml`'s "Run
owned pre-built native tests" step), just packed into one guest script
instead of a dozen workflow steps, because Recovery has no per-command exec:

    emit-guest-script --output PATH
        Write the bash-3.2/POSIX-sh-compatible script the guest runs. Pure
        function of nothing but the module constants, so it needs no
        arguments beyond where to write it.

    verify-collected --collected DIR --guest-exit-code CODE [--manifest ...]
        Read the guest's collected results (the action's `collect` tarball,
        already extracted by the workflow) plus its `exit-code` output, and
        fail with a named diagnostic per check. When `--manifest`,
        `--repo-root`, and `--target` are given, also runs the ownership
        inventory validation and the coverage summary check against the
        `all-list.json` / `list.json` / `junit.xml` the guest produced --
        the same two checks the native `target-run` path runs, just deferred
        to after collection because Recovery has no Linux-side inventory to
        validate the filter against before it boots (see
        `target_run_ownership.build_filter_expression`).

Guest facts this script is built around (see the PR description for the
source): Ventura Recovery, root, one script per boot; `sh`/`bash 3.2`,
`curl`, `tar` (bsdtar, no zstd); the action's blank qcow2 disk can be
formatted with `diskutil eraseDisk APFS Work <disk>` and mounted at
`/Volumes/Work`, falling back to `/tmp/work` (ramdisk) if that fails;
`cargo-nextest` decodes `.tar.zst` itself, so only the workspace and fixtures
tarballs need to be plain, uncompressed `.tar` for bsdtar to extract.

    """`mem_sample`: print one `[mem] ...` line describing guest memory.

    soldr#3136: the Recovery guest intermittently freezes mid-suite (5 of 8
    nightly replays 09-07..09-14) and the stall-collect cannot open a second
    Terminal, so nothing under `/tmp/results` survives a freeze. The only
    channel that does is the heartbeat tail of this script's stdout, so the
    sample goes there. Every probe degrades to `n/a` when Recovery lacks the
    tool or the key, rather than failing the stage.

    Field order is deliberate: the heartbeat is a 4000-byte tail, so a sample
    can be cut off mid-line. Free memory and the per-process aggregates come
    first, since they separate "processes accumulate across tests" from "one
    process grows", which is the question run 34847511968 left open. `name=N/SM`
    is the count and summed RSS of processes with that executable name.

    `reclaim_spec/purge/ext` is speculative, purgeable and file-backed pageable
    memory in MiB, and `comp` is compressor occupancy. Run 34863589272 showed
    `free` at 3M while the pressure level stayed normal: macOS keeps
    reclaimable cache out of `free`, so these separate a real exhaustion from a
    full cache (soldr#3136).

    selector matching zero tests is stale -- runs here instead, against the
