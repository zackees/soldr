"""Assert that DEPENDENCY compilation stays warm across a nextest archive build.

## What changed, and why (soldr#1391 -> soldr#2931 / soldr#2937)

soldr#1391 built this harness around the invariant "the full linked nextest
archive must be warm-cacheable: positive hits and **zero** misses". soldr#2931
inverted that policy. Cache admission follows the stability of an artifact's
identity key relative to its size, and by that measure a **linked test product
is never cacheable**: a test binary is one of the largest things the build
produces and its key moves with every source edit in the workspace. Requiring
it to be a cache hit was requiring the store to carry exactly what the policy
now forbids -- and it made the lane red for weeks over units that were never
supposed to be reused.

The valuable half of the old check survives unchanged: **dependency
compilation must still be warm**. That is the property a compilation cache
exists to deliver, it is Tier 1 (`cook`) plus Tier 2 (`zccache-unit`) in the
soldr#2931 tiering, and it regresses silently.

So the assertion is now:

* the warm run must reuse the compiler cache at all (`warm_hits > 0`); and
* **no dependency unit may miss** on the warm run.

First-party units -- everything named `soldr*`, which is where every
test-harness LINK product lives -- are reported with their miss counts and are
never a failure. They are not expected or required to be cache hits.

## Why it is still a Docker harness

The source tree is bind-mounted, but Cargo's target dir, CARGO_HOME, and the
soldr home live on Linux Docker volumes so Cargo mtimes and zccache state are
not distorted by Windows bind-mount behavior.
