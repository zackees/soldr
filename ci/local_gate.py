"""soldr's local gate (zackees/ci.yml#166, GATE-001..004).

One command that is a superset of the remote quick gate, so a PR passes CI
on its first push:

    uv run --no-project --python 3.13 python ci/local_gate.py             # every lane
    uv run --no-project --python 3.13 python ci/local_gate.py --lane lint # = the remote Lint job
    uv run --no-project --python 3.13 python ci/local_gate.py --list

Do not call this directly before pushing; call it through the attesting
wrapper, which runs it on a clean tree and stamps HEAD with a tree-bound
`Local-Gate:` trailer that CI's `ci-mode` job verifies (see local-gate.toml):

    uvx --from git+https://github.com/zackees/ci.yml@<CI_LINT_REF> ci-lint local-gate run

Lanes:

- `lint` = `py-static` + `guards`: every check the remote `Lint` job runs.
  The Lint job runs exactly `ci/local_gate.py --lane lint` and nothing else
  (GATE-001), so this list is the single source of truth for it.
  `py-static` (ruff, flake8, isort, format, pylint, mypy) reads only Python;
  `guards` (repository-scanning guard scripts, the Python tests) read
  everything. They are separate lanes so the gate can cache them separately
  (GATE-007, zackees/ci.yml#177).
- `ci-lint`: `soldr lint ci` and dependency policy (deny bans, audit,
  machete) -- seconds, CI surfaces and lockfiles.
- `rust`: rustfmt, Clippy and Dylint -- ci-test's own commands, run by the
  host's soldr. Local only (the remote `build-linux-x64` job runs the same
  stages inside `soldr ci-test`).
- `cross`: Clippy and Dylint for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`, cross-checked from this Linux host (zackees/ci.yml
  #198 phase 2). They attest `rust/<target>/{clippy,dylint}`; no PR job
  covers those targets, so this is added coverage, not a skipped job.
- `wine`: Windows-MSVC unit tests of the crates that pass in full under
  Wine, cross-built here and executed in `docker/wine-test`, never on the
  host (`ci/wine_lane.py`; zackees/ci.yml#202 phase 3).
- `winvm`: the Windows-MSVC target-run partition (`_ci-target-run.yml`'s
  owned selection), built here and replayed natively in a warm local
  dockur/windows VM (`ci/winvm_lane.py`). Host-optional: with no VM it exits
  75 and local-gate records `winvm:n/a` -- not cached, not attested, and the
  gate passes (zackees/ci.yml#202, ci_lint 9687a0b).
- `tests`: soldr's own test suite, in bosn's isolated container
  (`bosn run --task test`), never on the host (GATE-005, soldr#3516).

Native *execution* (macOS, Windows, linux-arm64 target-runs) cannot run here
and stays remote; it is the residual first-push risk. Their *lints* run here
(`cross` lane).

Checks in a lane run in parallel; each one's output is shown only when it
fails, then a timing table. Exit 1 when any check fails.

        # clean as of this change, so the whole tree is checked and this stays a
        # regression guard rather than a new policy.
        # The sixth and last tool from `./lint`, and the one the issue is named
        # for: pylint reported 319 findings, so `./lint` (which runs under
        # `set -e`) could never reach its final line.
        #
        # 315 of the 319 were in `tests/` and were pytest idiom, not defects --
        # fixtures shadowing their own names, tests reaching into the private
        # functions they exist to test. `src/` had four, all deliberate, all now
        # carrying an inline disable that states the reason at the site.
        #
        # So the two surfaces are checked with two rulesets. `src/` runs pylint's
        # DEFAULT configuration -- nothing disabled -- and scores 10.00/10. Only
        # `tests/` gets the relaxations, and they live in `tests/.pylintrc` with
        # a per-entry rationale. Passing that file explicitly rather than relying
        # on pylint's directory discovery means it applies where it is named and
        # nowhere else.
        # pytest in the ephemeral env for the same reason as the mypy step
        # below: 22 test files import it, and pylint reports import-error for
        # what it cannot resolve.
        #
        # pyyaml for the same reason, on the three invocations that reach a
        # file importing it (five under tests/, plus check_workflow_python_pin
        # under .github/scripts). mypy already carries types-PyYAML; pylint
        # needs the real package, because E0401 is about importability rather
        # than typing. This was masked for as long as it existed: the Python
        # tests step runs first, and it had been failing on a collection error
        # since #2823, so pylint never got to report.
        # pylint gets `.github/actions/setup-soldr` rather than the parent
        # `.github/actions`: ensure_soldr.py imports its sibling module, which
        # only resolves when pylint has that leaf directory on its path.
        # Pointed at the parent it reports E0401 for an import that is fine.
        # The other five tools resolve it either way and take the parent.

        # `test_*.py` in this directory are pytest suites, so they take the
