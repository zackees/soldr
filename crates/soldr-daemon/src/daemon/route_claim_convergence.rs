//! Converge a route request on its generation's claimed daemon (soldr#3561).
//!
//! A route's claim slot is keyed by its broker `service_name`, which names the
//! canonical root, Soldr version, and daemon image digest. The SESSION
//! endpoint a launcher expects, however, is derived from the *executable path*
//! of the image it placed (`broker_identity::daemon_session_endpoint_from_executable`),
//! and one image digest can sit at more than one path: the placement directory
//! carries the placing broker's own version and build provenance
//! (`self_relocate::relocation_dir_name`), and the file name is the
//! registered source's. A daemon placed by one broker build survives a broker
//! restart, keeps this generation's root-owner lock, and publishes its claim
//! into the same slot.
//!
//! Comparing the claim's endpoint against the path-derived one therefore made
//! every later request for the generation wait out its whole acquisition
//! window on `daemon route claim endpoint mismatch`, while the generation's one
//! daemon was live and serving. Identity is the image digest, not a path: a
//! claim is adopted when its recorded BLAKE3 equals the route's image digest
//! and `BackendHandle::probe_with_service` then verifies, at the claim's own
//! endpoint, that the live PID runs exactly that executable (path, hash, boot
//! ID) and answers the nonce challenge. A claim for another image is never
//! adopted, so foreign generations are left untouched.
