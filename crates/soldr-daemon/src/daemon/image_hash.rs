//! Fingerprint-cached blake3 hashing of the daemon image (soldr#2442 / 0.9.0
//! cold-start perf).
//!
//! The broker verifies the `soldr-daemon` image before spawning it, and the
//! front door hashes the same image to register its identity. That image is a
//! large binary, and the cold path used to read it fully three-to-four times
//! per launch (`std::fs::read` + SHA-256 at every site) — ~19s under concurrent
//! cold I/O in a Docker VM. This module replaces that with:
//!
//! - **blake3** via zccache's shared, streaming hasher (`zccache::hash::hash_file`
//!   — no new dependency, and the whole binary is never loaded into RAM); and
//! - a **fingerprint cache** keyed on `(path, size, mtime)`: a prior hash of the
//!   exact same file (same size and mtime) is reused instead of re-reading the
//!   binary. A miss, a stale fingerprint, or any unreadable / malformed cache
//!   entry falls back to recomputation — the cache only ever *skips work*, it
//!   never returns a hash for content it did not read.
//!
//! The `(size, mtime)` freshness model matches how cargo and zccache already
//! decide a build artifact is unchanged. It is not an adversarial integrity
//! boundary — the daemon-image label the caller compares against remains the
//! boundary; this only accelerates producing the hash value on both sides.
