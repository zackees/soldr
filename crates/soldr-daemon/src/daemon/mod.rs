//! soldr-daemon — long-lived process that owns target/ tracking, build
//! event correlation (Phase 2), and linked zccache shutdown (Phase 3).
//!
//! Phase 1 scope (this module): IPC server + sync client + PID-based
//! lifecycle, fronting the existing `TargetRegistry` redb writes. The
//! wrapper hot path tries the daemon first via a fire-and-forget
//! socket/pipe write with a 50 ms timeout, then falls back to writing
//! the redb file directly so a missing or unhealthy daemon never blocks
//! a build.
//!
//! The daemon binary is `soldr-daemon` (declared in
//! `crates/soldr-cli/Cargo.toml`); its entry point at
//! `src/bin/soldr_daemon.rs` delegates straight into `server::run()`.
//!
//! `dead_code` is allowed module-wide because the bin and lib compile
//! `daemon::*` independently — symbols used only by the integration
//! tests (lib path) or only by the daemon entry point (bin path) would
//! otherwise be flagged in the other build.
