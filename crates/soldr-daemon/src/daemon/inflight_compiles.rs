//! soldr#3053 — process-global registry of compiles currently executing
//! inside the embedded zccache service, so an RSS-ceiling breach dump can
//! name WHICH compiles the daemon was holding, not just how much RSS it
//! held. CLAUDE.md's "Diagnosing before capping" section is explicit that
//! cgroup OOM counters alone are not sufficient evidence for a memory
//! incident; the compiler's own peak-RSS telemetry plus this registry's
//! in-flight unit list are what turn "the daemon OOMed" into "the daemon
//! OOMed while holding these N units".
//!
//! This is a process-global `static`, not a field on
//! `EmbeddedZccacheService`, because the reader
//! (`daemon::rss_ceiling::write_breach_dump`) is a free function running on
//! the watchdog task and has no handle to the service instance -- the
//! watchdog and the service are independent tasks that only share the
//! process.
//!
//! The broker runs the exact same watchdog and never calls [`register`], so
//! [`snapshot`] returning an empty list from a broker process is correct,
//! not a bug -- `BreachSummary::role` is what disambiguates "empty because
//! broker" from "empty because idle daemon" for a dump reader.
//!
//! Deliberately records only unit *identity* -- crate name and the
//! `<crate>/<metadata>` unit key -- never argv or env. A breach dump is
//! sometimes shared outside the machine that produced it, so it must never
//! carry environment secrets.
