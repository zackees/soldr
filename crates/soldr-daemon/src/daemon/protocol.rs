/// Protocol version bump rationale:
///
/// * v1–v2: pre-PID-file lifecycle.
/// * v3: target-touch + build-session correlation + linked-zccache.
/// * v4: cook-index IPC (CookLookup, CookRecord, CookTouch) +
///   `cook_stats` on `StatusInfo`. Bincode-bodied wire frames.
/// * v5 (#580): wire body switches from bincode to prost (Protocol
///   Buffers). The header layout is unchanged so the IPC version
///   check still triggers on cross-version traffic.
/// * v5 retained in #603: the wire format did not change — #603 only
///   drops the bincode fallback at the redb layer. Old (v4) clients
///   trying to talk to a v5 daemon (and vice versa) still get a
///   clean "protocol version mismatch" error.
/// * v6 (#977 Phase 5 / #980 L1): adds `Request::Compile` and
///   `Response::CompileResponse` so the rustc-wrapper dispatches every
///   compile to the daemon's embedded `ZccacheService`. The legacy
///   fork-zccache.exe path is gone (#980 L1 second pass) — wrappers
///   that can't reach a v6 daemon hard-error instead of falling back.
/// * v7 (#983 Phase 5b): the daemon stops emitting the single-frame
///   `Response::Compile` for `Request::Compile`. Instead it streams a
///   sequence of `Response::CompileStdoutChunk` / `CompileStderrChunk`
///   frames followed by exactly one terminal `Response::CompileDone`
///   frame. Wrapper-side memory drops from "full rustc stdout+stderr
///   buffered before display" to "at most one chunk in flight". The
///   v6 `CompileResponse` slot is kept on the wire for one release
///   cycle so cross-version traffic still errors as a clean version
///   mismatch instead of a silent oneof mis-decode.
/// * v8 (#1286 F1): adds `Request::FlushCaches` so `soldr save` /
///   `soldr cache flush` can checkpoint the embedded zccache state
///   (artifact index, depgraph snapshot, metadata cache) to disk
///   without shutting the daemon down. Before v8 that state was
///   memory-only until a graceful daemon exit, so archives taken from
///   a live daemon restored with zero rustc hits.
/// * v9 (soldr#1368): adds `Request::CompileStats` so `soldr session
///   end` can read the embedded zccache service's cumulative
///   hit/miss/time-saved counters over IPC and diff them against a
///   session-start baseline — replacing the old `zccache session-end`
///   subprocess against the (removed) managed binary.
/// * v10 (soldr#820): extends `BuildRecord` with optional cache summary,
///   log/archive paths, and miss-reason rollups for `soldr logs`.
/// * v11 (soldr#1467): removes `Request::LinkZccache`,
///   `ZccacheDaemonLink`, and `StatusInfo.linked_zccache` — the
///   external managed-zccache daemon the link tracked was deleted in
///   soldr#1368, so there is nothing left to stop on daemon shutdown.
/// * v12 (soldr#1537): carries optional build-session lifecycle metadata
///   on `CompileRequest`, eliminating two hot-path telemetry IPC calls.
/// * v13 (soldr#1536): `Request::BuildSessionEnd` becomes
///   request-response — the daemon finalizes the session from its
///   in-memory per-session aggregate and replies [`Response::Ack`] once
///   the BuildRecord and every staged session event are durable. No
///   message body changed shape, but the interaction pattern did: a v13
///   client would wait on a reply a v12 daemon never sends, so the bump
///   makes cross-version traffic fail fast (and displace the stale
///   daemon) instead of stalling out the reply timeout.
/// * v14: `CompileStatsInfo` carries zccache phase-profile telemetry so
///   session reports can gate staged-output behavior.
/// * v15 (#1675): `BuildSessionStart` is request-response so persistence
///   failures cannot be acknowledged as successful.
/// * v16 (soldr#1735): a bounded Windows IPC queue reports backpressure
///   and exposes its burst counters through daemon status.
/// * v17: `FlushCaches` returns a structured persistence report instead
///   of an empty Ack, preserving pending/index drain failures and each
///   embedded zccache save step's completed/failed/timed-out outcome.
/// * v18: shutdown acknowledgements and status both carry the daemon
///   generation that accepted the request. Callers can now wait for that
///   exact responder without trusting a PID sampled before the request or
///   signalling a successor after PID reuse.
/// * v19 (soldr#1814 criterion 2 — the daemon becomes the single owner of
///   its own tables): adds `BuildLogInputs`, so the daemon serves the event
///   rows and build record `build_log` previously read by opening
///   `state.sqlite3` itself (slice 2a); and `ShouldWarnCargoDebugDefault`, so
///   the cargo-debug-default read-modify-write stops making every front-door
///   invocation another opener (slice 2c); and `AttachBuildLogHistory`, so the
///   front-door tail stops doing its own get/mutate/upsert of the build
///   record (slice 2d).
/// * v20 (soldr#1838 Phase 2): adds `Retiring`, so a daemon that is shutting
///   down can distinguish graceful retirement from an internal compile error.
///   Mandatory broker clients surface either condition as a hard failure.
/// * v21 (soldr#2023): `StatusInfo` publishes the compile limit the daemon
///   actually applied at startup, and `BuildSessionStart` is acknowledged
///   with `BuildSessionStarted` (carrying the same pair) instead of a bare
///   `Ack`. A running daemon keeps its startup limit, so changing
///   `SOLDR_JOBS` used to be a silent no-op; publishing the applied value is
///   what lets a client notice and say so.
/// * v22 (soldr#2251): daemon-owned target registry snapshot/removal IPC.
/// * v23 (soldr#2866): cook record/hit messages carry the prior compile and
///   archive-save timings used by the conservative restore cost gate.
/// * v24 (soldr#3024): adds a connection-scoped resident-capacity lease.
///   Acquisition reserves embedded compile permits until the same control
///   stream releases them or disconnects.
