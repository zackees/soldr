//! soldr#3053 item 4 — process-global registry of the daemon's own
//! kill/cancel decisions, so a breach dump can list the ones pending (and
//! recently resolved) at breach time. Mirrors
//! `daemon::inflight_compiles` exactly in shape: a process-global
//! `static Mutex`, a monotonic `SEQ`, an RAII guard, and a `snapshot()`
//! free function -- the reader is the same breach-dump path and has no
//! handle to the thing making the decision, only the process it runs in.
//!
//! Two kinds of decision are recorded today: `terminate-pid` (lifecycle's
//! SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL escalation) and `cancel-on-disconnect` (dropping an
//! in-flight compile future when the IPC client goes away). Both are
//! "the daemon decided to end something", which is exactly the context a
//! breach dump wants next to the RSS numbers and the in-flight compile
//! list: not just what the daemon was holding, but what it was already
//! doing about it.
