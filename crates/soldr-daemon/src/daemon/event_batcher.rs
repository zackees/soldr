//! L4 (issue soldr#980): coalesce per-compile redb transactions into a
//! background flusher.
//!
//! ## Problem
//!
//! Pre-L4, every `Request::RecordCompile` IPC call landed in
//! [`crate::daemon::db::append_event`], which opens the shared
//! `state.sqlite3`, runs a write txn to bump `next_event_id` (fsync #1) and
//! a second write txn to insert the event row (fsync #2). The cold
//! profile recorded 171 compile misses ≈ ~342 fsyncs ≈ ~3.4 s of
//! pure-sync wait on Windows/WSL2 at ~10 ms/fsync. None of those events
//! is critical-path for the build itself; they are diagnostics consumed
//! by `soldr daemon status` and `soldr daemon ls-builds` after the build
//! finishes.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! [`EventBatcher::start`] spawns one background tokio task that owns the
//! redb writer. The hot path ([`EventBatcher::record`]) just pushes a
//! [`crate::daemon::db::Event`] onto a bounded mpsc channel — a few
//! microseconds at most. The drain task batches up to
//! [`MAX_BATCH_ROWS`] rows OR up to [`MAX_BATCH_LATENCY`] of wall time
//! before opening a single redb write txn that allocates a contiguous
//! range of event IDs and inserts every staged row in one fsync.
//!
//! On `BuildSessionEnd` and on daemon shutdown the server sends an
//! explicit [`BatcherCmd::Flush`] with a oneshot acknowledgement so the
//! caller can confirm every staged row landed before the session is
//! treated as finalized.
//!
//! soldr#1536: the batcher additionally maintains an in-memory
//! [`SessionAggregate`] per build session, updated synchronously in
//! [`EventBatcher::record`]. `BuildSessionEnd` consumes it via
//! [`EventBatcher::take_session_aggregate`] so finalization is
//! proportional to the current session instead of scanning (and
//! prost-decoding) the entire retained `daemon_events` table; the
//! historical `aggregate_session` scan remains only as the fallback for
//! sessions this daemon process did not observe from their start.
//!
//! ## Race window
//!
//! A reader querying redb between two flushes (e.g. a `soldr daemon
//! status` racing with an in-progress build) sees a snapshot that does
//! NOT include rows still buffered in memory. This is acceptable for the
//! per-compile diagnostic path — at worst the operator sees one or two
//! fewer events than the daemon will eventually persist; the next
//! interval tick / batch-fullness trip will flush the rest. No data is
//! lost: shutdown and `BuildSessionEnd` both force a flush before they
//! complete, and the `Drop` semantics of the mpsc receiver mean even an
//! aborted task drains the channel one more time before exiting.
