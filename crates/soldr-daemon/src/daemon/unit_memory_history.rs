//! Per-unit measured peak memory, remembered across builds (soldr#3152 step 4).
//!
//! The owner's decision for memory-aware admission: remember the last measured
//! peak of each compile unit and admit on it, instead of predicting peak memory
//! from command-line features. The first 1,161 joined CI units showed those
//! features barely predict it (R\u{b2} 0.09 on `--extern` bytes), while a unit's
//! measured peak is stable from run to run.
//!
//! Units are keyed by `memory_estimate::unit_key` (`<crate name>/<cargo -C
//! metadata>`), the identity that survives zccache rewriting the argument
//! vector. The measurement comes from zccache's per-compile `ChildMemory`:
//! the compiler's own high-water mark and the sampled peak of its whole live
//! process tree, which is the one that includes a linking `rustc`'s `ld`.
//!
//! Rows live in the shared `state.sqlite3` table `unit_memory_history` as
//! `[0x01][prost WireUnitMemory]`, like every other persisted row.
