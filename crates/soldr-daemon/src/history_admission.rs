//! Admission that spends each unit's measured memory history (soldr#3152 step 4b).
//!
//! The owner chose a per-unit history over a command-line-feature estimate.
//! Scored on #3250's CI run, every unit measuring >= 256 MiB was within 1.35x
//! of its remembered tree peak; the only large errors were first sightings of
//! short compiles (a single spawn-instant reading just above the 8 MiB floor).
//!
//! This first step is **additive**: history can make a unit exclusive, never
//! the reverse, so no unit loses the protection today's classifier gives it.
//! A unit becomes exclusive when its headroomed remembered peak exceeds half
//! of the memory available right now, i.e. two such units could not run side
//! by side. Replacing the slot semaphore with memory-sized permits and
//! retiring the name lists come after this has run in CI.
