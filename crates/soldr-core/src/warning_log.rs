//! Warnings soldr emitted earlier in a run, so a later failure can repeat them.
//!
//! soldr#1999 rule 1: *a diagnostic emitted before a failure must be attached
//! to that failure*, not left upstream in the log.
//!
//! The failure mode it addresses: soldr warns during a build — the fast linker
//! was unavailable, a restore was partial, a fallback could not be persisted —
//! and then the build fails much later. The warning is still in the log, but
//! hundreds of Cargo progress lines above the error, so the person reading the
//! failure never connects the two and starts debugging the wrong subsystem.
//! soldr#1992 is the worked example: the rust-lld retry notice sat unlinked
//! while the user read a bare `could not compile`.
//!
//! Deliberately a *record-and-replay*, not a buffer. Warnings are still
//! printed the moment they happen — someone watching a live build must not
//! have to wait for a failure to learn something went wrong, and a build that
//! succeeds should still show them. Replay only adds a second copy where it is
//! needed, next to the error.
