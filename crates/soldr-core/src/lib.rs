//! soldr-core — the foundation crate of the #1490 workspace split.
//!
//! Owns the shared types every other soldr crate reaches for: target
//! triple resolution, `~/.soldr/` layout (`SoldrPaths` / `SoldrConfig`),
//! `SoldrError`, the daemon wire schema (`core::wire`), the shared
//! Windows Defender exclusion plumbing, and shared per-test
//! watchdog. No I/O beyond config files.
//!
//! The `core` tree stays nested as `pub mod core;` (not flattened) so
//! `crate::core::…` paths inside the moved files — and
//! `soldr_cli::core::…` paths via the facade re-export — resolve
//! unchanged (#1490 mechanics rule M1).
