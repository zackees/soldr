//! Graceful-terminate request on Windows (soldr#3096; formerly a parked
//! hook under soldr#3059 / issue #1286 — see `platform/process/signal.rs`
//! for the history of what the caller does with this).
//!
//! Windows has no POSIX SIGTERM: `TerminateProcess` is a kernel kill that
//! runs no code in the target, so a daemon that only had that primitive
//! could never take its fast-exit path (write the `died-signal-fast`
//! lifecycle marker, say so on stderr, exit 1). This module supplies the
//! Windows equivalent of SIGTERM as a named, auto-reset Win32 event:
//!
//! - the daemon creates `Local\soldr-daemon-terminate-<pid>` when it
//!   registers its terminate hook ([`wait_for_terminate_signal`]) and a
//!   dedicated thread blocks on it in `WaitForSingleObject`;
//! - a terminator opens that event with `EVENT_MODIFY_STATE` and
//!   `SetEvent`s it ([`request_graceful_terminate`]); when no such event
//!   exists (not a soldr daemon, or a daemon predating this mechanism)
//!   the caller falls back to `TerminateProcess`.
//!
//! The waiter is a plain `std::thread`, not `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`:
//! the daemon drops its runtime after `block_on` returns on the graceful
//! path, and a runtime drop joins the blocking pool — a thread parked
//! forever in `WaitForSingleObject` would wedge that shutdown. A detached
//! std thread is simply discarded at process exit.
//!
//! The name lives in the `Local\` (session-private) namespace: the daemon
//! and whoever stops it run in the same logon session, and pids are only
//! meaningful within one.
