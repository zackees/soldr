/// separated list of `embed`, `live`, `api`, `quickinstall` (e.g.
/// `SOLDR_RESOLVER_ORDER=live,api` to skip the embedded blob,
/// `SOLDR_RESOLVER_ORDER=api` to skip both manifest hops). Unset or
/// empty → all four hops fire in the default order. Tokens not in the
/// known-set are warned about and ignored; if no token is recognised the
/// value falls back to all hops, so a typo can never disable the
/// sha-pinned manifest hops. The `api` and `quickinstall` hops are gated too.
///
/// `quickinstall` (soldr#3700) runs only after the `api` hop misses (or is
/// excluded) for an exact version; QuickInstall publishes no checksum, so
/// its assets are trust-`unverified` unless `SOLDR_CHECKSUMS_FILE` pins them.
///
/// The `api` hop is always last when listed — there is no way to
/// re-order the hops, only to disable them. This keeps the trust
/// posture intact: a hit from the embed/live manifest is sha-pinned;
/// a hit from the api path is not. Promoting the api path above either
/// manifest path would silently downgrade integrity.
