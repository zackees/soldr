//! Bounded-memory response-body downloads for release and toolchain assets.
//!
//! Metadata requests intentionally retain their short response-wide deadlines.
//! Archive payloads instead use this module: a successful chunk resets the
//! idle timer, so a healthy multi-gigabyte transfer is not killed by elapsed
//! wall time, while a stalled or truncated response remains retryable.
//!
//! ## Segmented downloads (setup-soldr `feat/segmented-download-experiment`, soldr#2320)
//!
//! `stream_response_to_temp_file[_with_safety_timeout]` transparently tries
//! N-way HTTP Range segmentation before falling back to the single-stream
//! loop below. This is a deliberate design choice, not an afterthought: it
//! is the ONLY place in `soldr-fetch` allowed to touch `reqwest` directly
//! (`dylints/ban_raw_network_access` denies raw reqwest calls everywhere
//! else under `crates/soldr-fetch/src/`), so folding segmentation in here
//! is what lets every existing caller â€” `syslib_common.rs`, `xwin_cache.rs`,
//! `archive.rs`, `llvm.rs`, `zig.rs`, `apple_sdk.rs`, `rustup_init.rs`,
//! `manifest_lookup.rs` â€” inherit it with **zero call-site changes**. They
//! keep calling `get_request` + `send_asset_request` +
//! `stream_response_to_temp_file` exactly as before.
//!
//! The trick: by the time a caller's already-sent `response` reaches this
//! function, its headers (`Content-Length`, `Accept-Ranges`) are already
//! available for free â€” no extra probe request needed. If they indicate a
//! large, range-capable resource, this module abandons that response
//! (its body is never read) and issues its own N parallel `Range` requests
//! through a freshly built client. If segmentation was never attempted, or
//! it fails for any reason, the ORIGINAL `response` â€” never drained, still
//! perfectly valid â€” is what gets streamed by the existing single-stream
//! loop below. That is the whole fallback-safety argument: segmentation can
//! only ever add a path to success, never remove the one that already
//! worked.
//!
//! ### Why default-on
//!
//! `crates/soldr-fetch/examples/dl_bench.rs` measured single-stream vs
//! segmented downloads against the real CDNs this module talks to
//! (media.githubusercontent.com LFS-style assets, GitHub release
//! signed-URL redirects): single-stream was capped at a strikingly
//! consistent ~2-2.3 MB/s on every origin tested, while segmentation
//! scaled with no plateau through N=16, landing at **8.6-10.3x** the
//! single-stream throughput and matching `aria2c -x16` within noise on
//! every URL. That is not a marginal, opt-in-only win â€” it is the
//! difference between the maintainer's named xwin MSVCRT pain point and a
//! four-second download. Combined with the fallback-safety argument above
//! (a segmentation failure can never make a download that used to succeed
//! start failing), the default is ON, with an opt-OUT escape hatch for the
//! rare host/proxy where it turns out not to help.
//!
//! ### Protocol inheritance (Http1Only vs Negotiated)
//!
//! Several callers pin `AssetProtocol::Http1Only` for their single-stream
//! client (`syslib_common.rs`, `llvm.rs`, `zig.rs`, `apple_sdk.rs`) as a
//! defensive fix for historical large-binary-download stalls (see
//! `git log -S http1_only` starting at PR #963); `xwin_cache.rs` never
//! carried that pin and has shipped without it since PR #1016 with no
//! reported incident. Because this module builds its OWN client for the
//! segmented request fan-out (it cannot reuse the caller's client â€” only
//! the caller's already-completed `response` is available), it has no
//! direct way to see which protocol the caller originally pinned. Instead
//! it infers the safe choice from `response.version()`: if the caller's
//! single connection negotiated HTTP/1.x (either because it was pinned, or
//! because that is what the server offered), the segmented fan-out also
//! pins HTTP/1-only; if it negotiated HTTP/2+, the segmented fan-out lets
//! reqwest negotiate freely too. This preserves every existing pin's
//! intent without any caller needing to pass its protocol choice through â€”
//! "whatever pin stream_download applies stays owned by stream_download."
//! `dl_bench.rs` separately confirmed empirically that Negotiated works
//! fine against all three benchmarked origins (including the exact mingw
//! bundle whose PR introduced `syslib_common.rs`'s pin), so this inference
//! is conservative-by-construction rather than load-bearing for
//! correctness today.
//!
//! ### Three clocks per segment attempt
//!
//! 1. **Connect/TTFB** (`SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 10s):
//!    request issuance to first response byte (i.e. until headers are
//!    available). Re-armed fresh on every redirect hop â€” reqwest's own
//!    auto-redirect would share one `.send()` future across every hop,
//!    making a per-hop timeout impossible, so the segmented client
//!    disables auto-redirect (`redirect::Policy::none()`) and follows
//!    hops manually (`send_with_hop_timeout`), each with its own
//!    `tokio::time::timeout`. A connect/TTFB expiry is not fatal to the
//!    segment â€” it goes through the normal per-segment retry path.
//! 2. **Stall watchdog** (`SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_STALL_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default
//!    30s): arms only once the body-chunk loop starts (i.e. after clock 1
//!    already ended successfully) and resets on every chunk. A slow TLS
//!    handshake or a server that takes a while to start streaming is
//!    clock 1's problem, never clock 2's.
//! 3. **Whole-operation deadline** (`SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECS`,
//!    disabled by default): spans every phase of one `stream_response_to_
//!    temp_file` call, segmented attempt and single-stream fallback alike.
//!
//! Permit-wait time (see "Two connection pools" below) counts against
//! NONE of these: a segment acquires its pool permit FIRST, and only then
//! starts clock 1. Otherwise a busy pool would manufacture spurious
//! connect-timeout failures purely from FIFO queueing delay.
//!
//! ### Two connection pools (process-wide, soldr#2320 addendum 3)
//!
//! Two independent, non-borrowing pools bound total concurrent payload
//! connections:
//!
//! * **Bulk** (`SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_MAX_SOCKETS`, default 16): every segment of
//!   a segmented download, plus the single-stream fallback for anything
//!   ABOVE the quick threshold. Clocks, retries, and preemption all live
//!   here.
//! * **Quick** (`SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_QUICK_POOL`, default 4): plain FIFO, no
//!   preemption. Used for (a) every control-plane request (catalogue
//!   JSON, API probes, redirect-resolution HEADs) and (b) whole downloads
//!   whose `Content-Length` is known and at or below
//!   `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_QUICK_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (default 4 MiB) â€” the same
//!   threshold also doubles as the segmentation minimum, so anything
//!   small enough to route through Quick is also never segmented; there
//!   is exactly one size boundary, not two independently-tunable ones.
//!   A response with unknown size (no `Content-Length`) always routes to
//!   Bulk â€” conservative, since Quick's small pool would otherwise be an
//!   easy target for an unbounded transfer to starve.
//!
//! There is no cross-pool borrowing; the hard ceiling on total concurrent
//! payload+control connections is `bulk + quick`. The motivating scenario
//! this exists for: `soldr prepare` materializing several large managed
//! bundles (cmake, ninja, LLVM, xwin) saturates Bulk with long-lived
//! segment streams, while a small catalogue/manifest lookup on Quick must
//! still complete promptly instead of queueing behind them.
//!
//! ### Permit preemption ("work stealing", soldr#2320 addendum 2, Bulk only)
//!
//! A Bulk permit is PENDING from acquisition until the holder's connect
//! phase (clock 1, across every redirect hop) finishes and the first
//! payload byte is about to be read; from there it is STREAMING and can
//! never be preempted. Quick permits skip this distinction entirely â€”
//! they are marked STREAMING immediately on acquisition, since Quick
//! never preempts. A background scheduler tick (~1s) steals a PENDING
//! Bulk permit for a FIFO waiter only when: a waiter exists right now,
//! the victim has been PENDING for at least a ~2s grace period, and the
//! victim has been preempted fewer than 2 times (the anti-livelock guard
//! â€” past that it becomes permanently non-preemptible so a uniformly slow
//! network still converges instead of cycling forever). Preemption is not
//! a failure: the victim's segment re-queues FIFO for a fresh permit, its
//! retry budget is untouched, and preemptions are counted separately from
//! retries. Tail hedging (duplicate the slowest pending segment onto an
//! idle permit, first byte wins) is explicitly out of scope here â€” it did
//! not fall out cleanly from this state model without materially more
//! machinery, so it is left as a documented follow-up rather than rushed.
//!
//! ### Deferred (soldr#2320 addendum 4) -- recorded, not implemented here
//!
//! - **Scheduler-task lifecycle**: [`SocketPool::new`] spawns its
//!   preemption-tick task with no shutdown/cancellation handle; it lives
//!   as long as the process (or, in tests, as long as the owning
//!   single-threaded runtime). Fine for the one process-wide Bulk/Quick
//!   singleton; would need a handle if this ever became a per-request
//!   object.
//! - **`spawn_blocking` for segment writes**: `write_at`/`write_at_all`
//!   run synchronous positional file I/O directly on the async task
//!   rather than via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. Fine for the small,
//!   fast local writes this does today; revisit if segment counts or
//!   write sizes grow enough for this to matter.
//! - **N-knee**: phase 1 measured no plateau through N=16 (the largest
//!   tested); whether higher N keeps helping is unprobed.
//! - **Caller-side probe tokens**: [`AUTH_TOKEN_ENV_VAR`] is forward-prep
//!   only -- there is no probe-then-reuse-a-resolved-URL path (each
//!   request, including every redirect hop, resolves independently; see
//!   "Cross-origin redirects strip Authorization" below for why that
//!   matters for auth specifically).
//!
//! ### Cross-origin redirects strip `Authorization` (soldr#2320 addendum 4 item 2)
//!
//! [`send_with_hop_timeout`] compares scheme+host+port between the
//! original request and each redirect hop's resolved URL. The
//! `Authorization: Bearer` header (from [`AUTH_TOKEN_ENV_VAR`], forward-
//! prep for a future private MSVC origin) is attached only while the hop
//! stays same-origin; a redirect to a different origin never carries it
//! forward. This is the same posture reqwest's own auto-redirect takes
//! for sensitive headers on cross-origin hops, applied manually here
//! because the segmented client disables auto-redirect (see "Three
//! clocks").
//!
//! ### Three switches, not one (soldr#2320 addendum 4 item 1)
//!
//! There are three independent knobs here, each governing a different
//! layer, and conflating them was the critical review finding on the
//! first version of this module:
//!
//! 1. **Slicing** â€” `SOLDR_SEGMENTED_DOWNLOAD`. Whether a large,
//!    Range-capable response gets split into N parallel requests at all.
//!    Off means every download (small or large) takes exactly one
//!    connection, exactly like before this feature existed.
//! 2. **Capping** â€” `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_MAX_SOCKETS` (Bulk) /
//!    `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_QUICK_POOL` (Quick). How many connections each pool
//!    allows concurrently. **`0` means fully unconditional** for that
//!    pool: no permit object is created, no bookkeeping, no scheduler
//!    tick, nothing to wait on -- the literal pre-branch behavior, not
//!    merely a very large number. This is independent of switch 1: even
//!    with slicing off, the single remaining connection still acquires a
//!    permit from whichever pool it routes to, so `MAX_SOCKETS=0`/
//!    `QUICK_POOL=0` are the actual "make pooling a no-op" escape hatches.
//! 3. **QoS** â€” Bulk-vs-Quick routing (module docs "Two connection
//!    pools") and Bulk's PENDING/STREAMING preemption (module docs
//!    "Permit preemption"). Only meaningful when capping (switch 2) is
//!    actually in effect for the pool in question; policy for how
//!    contested capacity gets allocated and reclaimed.
//!
//! ### Knobs (defaults, env vars, units â€” all in one place)
//!
//! | Knob | Env var | Default | Unit |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Enable/disable (opt-out, switch 1) | `SOLDR_SEGMENTED_DOWNLOAD` | enabled (`off`/`0`/`false`/`no` disables, case-insensitive) | bool-ish |
//! | Segment count | `SOLDR_SEGMENTED_DOWNLOAD_N` | 16 | count, clamped to `[2, 16]` |
//! | Connect/TTFB timeout (clock 1) | `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 10 | seconds |
//! | Stall watchdog (clock 2) | `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_STALL_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 30 | seconds |
//! | Per-segment retry limit | `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_SEGMENT_RETRIES` | 3 | count, clamped to `[0, 10]` |
//! | Whole-operation deadline (clock 3, opt-in) | `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECS` | disabled | seconds |
//! | Bulk pool size (switch 2) | `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_MAX_SOCKETS` | 16 | count, `0` = unconditional |
//! | Quick pool size (switch 2) | `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_QUICK_POOL` | 4 | count, `0` = unconditional |
//! | Quick/segmentation threshold | `SOLDR_DOWNLOAD_QUICK_THRESHOLD_BYTES` | 4 MiB (4194304) | bytes |
//! | Bearer auth (forward-prep) | `SOLDR_TOOLCHAIN_AUTH_TOKEN` | unset | token string |
//!
//! Every env var fails safe to its documented default on unset or
//! unparseable input â€” never panics, never silently picks an unintended
//! extreme. The one exception, by design: for the two pool-size knobs,
//! `0` is not junk -- it is the explicit unconditional sentinel (see
//! "Three switches" above). Only unparseable/unset values fail safe to
//! the default (capped) size.
//!
//! ### Retry composition with `fetch::retry::with_backoff`
//!
//! Per-segment retries here are a NEW, innermost layer, entirely distinct
//! from â€” and never multiplying with â€” the existing outer
//! `with_asset_backoff`/`with_backoff` retry that callers wrap around their
//! whole `ensure_*` operation (e.g. `syslib_common::ensure_syslib_bundle`).
//! A stalled or failed segment retries its OWN byte range, resuming from
//! bytes already durably written, entirely within a single call to this
//! module â€” it never returns an error for that. Preemptions are cheaper
//! still: they never touch the retry counter at all (see "Permit
//! preemption"). The outer retry loop is only ever reached if the WHOLE
//! operation still fails after: segmentation was attempted and exhausted
//! all per-segment retries AND the subsequent single-stream fallback also
//! failed (its pre-existing idle/safety-timeout errors are unchanged by
//! any of this). So the layers nest without multiplying: segment-level
//! retries handle a single-connection blip cheaply and invisibly; the
//! outer loop still only re-runs the same number of times it always did,
//! for the same terminal reasons it always did.
