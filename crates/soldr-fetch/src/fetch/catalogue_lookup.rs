//! Toolchain-catalogue first asset resolver.
//!
//! Before consulting `api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/...`
//! the release-asset resolver consults the v1 catalogue published by
//! `zackees/soldr-toolchain` and served over GitHub Pages:
//!
//! ```text
//! https://zackees.github.io/soldr-toolchain/catalogue.v1.json
//! ```
//!
//! Migration (soldr#988): the legacy manifest-branch origin and its
//! nightly job were retired in Phase 5.
//! There is no fallback to a second URL — a catalogue miss degrades
//! straight to the live GitHub Releases API. Use the catalogue's own
//! producer (`scripts/build_catalogue_v1.py` on `zackees/soldr-toolchain`)
//! to publish new entries.
//!
//! Schema (intentionally flat — one row per (owner, repo, tag, asset) —
//! so the lookup is a single linear scan and the file is grep-friendly):
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "entries": [
//!     {
//!       "owner": "zackees",
//!       "repo":  "zccache",
//!       "tag":   "1.12.9",
//!       "asset": "zccache-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip",
//!       "url":   "https://github.com/zackees/zccache/releases/download/1.12.9/zccache-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip",
//!       "sha256": "0000...64hex"
//!     }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The index is fetched at most once per *resolved configuration* and
//! cached in a bounded, single-flight, process-wide LRU keyed on that
//! configuration (soldr#2951). Any failure — HTTP error, parse error,
//! timeout, network — degrades silently to an empty index so the
//! resolver falls back to the live GitHub Releases API. The integrity
//! invariant ("a hit MUST sha256-verify against the manifest's pin") is
//! the same trust posture as `apple_sdk` / `zig`: a mismatched download
//! is a hard error regardless of `SOLDR_TRUST_MODE`.
//!
//! ## Env-var seams
//!
//! * `SOLDR_TOOLCHAIN_ORIGIN` — override the catalogue origin (the
//!   resolver builds `{origin}/catalogue.v1.json`). See Phase 2.
//! * `SOLDR_TOOLCHAIN_CATALOGUE_URL` — override the full URL (testing
//!   + air-gapped mirrors). When set takes precedence over
//!     `SOLDR_TOOLCHAIN_ORIGIN`.
//! * `SOLDR_MANIFEST_DISABLE=1` — skip the catalogue lookup entirely;
//!   the resolver falls through to the live GitHub Releases API.
//!
//! ## Why a separate file from per-tool manifests?
//!
//! soldr-toolchain also publishes human-friendly per-tool manifests at
//! `<origin>/<tool>/manifest.json`. `catalogue.v1.json` is the flat,
//! sha-bearing index used by runtime fetches that need a single
//! `(owner, repo, tag, asset)` lookup before falling back to the live
//! GitHub Releases API.

// NOTE: there is deliberately no `reset_cache_for_tests` helper. The cache is
// keyed on the immutable `CatalogueConfig` snapshot (soldr#2951), so a test
// that points `SOLDR_TOOLCHAIN_CATALOGUE_URL` at its own one-shot server gets
// its own entry, and one that disables the catalogue gets the `Disabled`
// entry -- in any binary, under any runner. A reset hook would be a second
// way to reach the same state, and the first fix here already showed what two
// paths to one decision cost.
//
// What that does NOT buy is freedom from ordering: the key is derived from
// process environment, so a test mutating those variables still races every
// concurrent test in the same binary. That is why the integration tests take
// `common::catalogue_env::CatalogueEnvGuard`, which serialises the catalogue
// variables and restores their prior values -- including "was unset" -- on
// drop. An earlier note here claimed a fresh cache required "their own
// integration test binary"; soldr#2934 consolidated per-file binaries into
// category targets and made that premise false.
//
// The unit tests below still operate entirely on the pure `from_json` /
// `lookup` APIs and never touch the process-wide cache.
