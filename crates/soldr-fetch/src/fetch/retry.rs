//! Shared retry-with-exponential-backoff for network fetches (soldr#2132).
//!
//! This crate already retried transient network errors in three places
//! (`fetch::mod`, `fetch::llvm`, `fetch::zig`), each with its own copy of the
//! same loop and its own `ATTEMPTS` / `INITIAL_BACKOFF` pair set to the same
//! values. Seven other fetchers had none. That gap failed two lanes of the
//! v0.8.30 release build:
//!
//! ```text
//! soldr build: managed cmake unavailable for host aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:
//!   network error: error decoding response body
//! → error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core` / `std`
//! ```
//!
//! One truncated response body, and the build failed with an error naming the
//! wrong thing entirely.
//!
//! # What is and is not retried
//!
//! [`is_transient`] deliberately matches the predicate the existing loops
//! already used: [`SoldrError::Network`] and [`SoldrError::ToolNotFound`]
//! (a release asset that is not published *yet*). Everything else is fatal on
//! the first try — in particular a sha256 mismatch is
//! [`SoldrError::Other`]/[`SoldrError::Archive`] and must stay fatal. Retrying
//! an integrity failure would turn a hard stop into three more chances to
//! accept a bad artifact, which is worse than the flake this module exists to
//! absorb.
