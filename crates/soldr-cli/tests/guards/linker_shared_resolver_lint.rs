//! soldr#3276 §4/acceptance: the front door, `soldr build`, the PEP 517
//! path, and `soldr prepare` / `soldr toolchain prepare|ensure` must all
//! resolve the project linker choice through ONE shared function --
//! `linker::resolve_project_choice` (and its process-ambient wrapper
//! `resolve_project_choice_from_cwd`) -- never a hand-rolled duplicate of
//! the env > cargo-config > Cargo.toml-metadata > user-config > default
//! precedence chain.
//!
//! This is a static source lint, not a behavioral test: the precedence
//! chain itself (each declaration source, and that they agree) is unit-
//! tested directly against `resolve_project_choice` in
//! `crates/soldr-cli/src/linker_tests.rs`. What this guard proves is that
//! every one of the surfaces named in the issue actually calls that same
//! function rather than drifting into its own copy (the soldr#2945 lesson
//! this repo has already paid for once with the Dylint nightly).
