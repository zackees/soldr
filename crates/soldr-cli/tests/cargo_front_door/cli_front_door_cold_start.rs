//! soldr#2388 Step 3 — cold-start acceptance: the broker is unconditional, so a
//! front-door `soldr` invocation on a clean isolated root spawns **exactly one**
//! broker, and a second front-door invocation against the same endpoint does NOT
//! spawn a second (the front door is the sole broker-spawner and the broker
//! singleton-binds). This covers the broker half of the "one build → one
//! broker + one daemon" invariant #2364 calls for, exercised on the real
//! process harness (no Docker required).
