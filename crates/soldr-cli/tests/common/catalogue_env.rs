//! One barrier for the soldr-toolchain catalogue environment variables.
//!
//! soldr#2951: `manifest_lookup_disable` and `manifest_lookup_url_override`
//! used to be their own cargo-generated test binaries, so their bare
//! `set_var` / `remove_var` calls were single-threaded by construction and the
//! comments saying so were true. soldr#2934 consolidated per-file test
//! binaries into category targets, and both modules now run in ONE process, in
//! parallel, mutating the same variables — with each file still reading as
//! correct in isolation. That is precisely the shape `guards::env_lock_lint`
//! exists to catch, and precisely why "CI is green" was not evidence: nextest
//! gives every test its own process, so the race is invisible to the runner
//! the project actually uses.
//!
//! Scoped deliberately to the catalogue variables instead of aliasing onto
//! `TEST_PROCESS_ENV_LOCK`. Per that lint's own header, collapsing barriers
//! over *disjoint* variables buys no correctness and starved a test with a
//! short deadline the one time it was tried. The rule it enforces is that one
//! variable has one barrier — which this satisfies, because nothing else in
//! this crate's tests writes these names.
//!
//! Restoring beats clearing on teardown. These tests can run under an outer
//! dogfooded soldr that has its own catalogue configuration, so a blanket
//! `remove_var` would silently hand every later test a different environment
//! than it started with.
