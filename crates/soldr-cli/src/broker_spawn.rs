//! soldr#2361 Phase 2: the front door's "spawn the broker" allowlisted
//! exception. **Unconditional** (soldr#2388): every eligible top-level `soldr`
//! invocation that may need the broker spawns/confirms it, and the compile hot
//! path routes through it. Teardown commands never resurrect an absent broker.
//! There is no env-var opt-out — the broker-fronted daemon is the only
//! supported topology.
//!
//! Per the #2364 design, the front door is the sole broker-spawner, and the
//! broker is the sole daemon-spawner via `serve_launching_backends`. The
//! broker→daemon→SESSION compile path is proven end-to-end on the real-process
//! daemon and wrapper integration suites.
//!
//! The one invariant that must never regress: a `RUSTC_WRAPPER` re-entry
//! (`soldr /path/to/rustc ...`, cargo calling back into soldr once per
//! compile unit) must NEVER reach this code. That path is `run_main`'s
//! `wrapper::is_wrapper_invocation` branch, which returns before this
//! module's entry point is ever called -- see the call site in
//! `soldr_main.rs`. If a broker spawn attempt fired on every compile unit
//! instead of once at the top-level invocation, it would recreate the
//! spawn-storm this whole redesign exists to kill (soldr#2360: "154x root
//! ownership is busy"). [`front_door_broker_spawn_eligible`] is a pure,
//! directly-unit-testable predicate for exactly this reason -- the call site
//! placement is a second, structural line of defense, not the only one.
//!
//! Spawns via `running_process::spawn_daemon_with_stdio_and_env_policy`
//! (the same detach machinery `soldr-daemon`'s own client-spawns-daemon path
//! uses, see `soldr_daemon::daemon::lifecycle::spawn::spawn_detached`) rather
//! than a bare `std::process::Command::spawn()`. A bare spawn on Windows
//! stays attached to the caller's job object / console, so a shell (or a
//! sandboxed tool harness) that waits for the whole descendant tree to exit
//! hangs on the long-lived broker even though the direct child (this `soldr`
//! invocation) has already returned -- caught by hand while smoke-testing
//! this against the real binary, not by any written test.
