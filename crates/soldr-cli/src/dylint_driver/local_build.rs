//! Tier 2 of the Dylint driver resolution ladder: a cached local build of
//! `dylint_driver` (soldr#2349).
//!
//! Split out of `dylint_driver.rs` by `.github/scripts/loc_ceiling.py`'s
//! hard 1,000-physical-line ceiling — this module is the moved tier-2
//! implementation, not a rewrite; behaviour is unchanged from before the
//! cut. See `dylint_driver.rs`'s module doc for the three-policy overview
//! (binary-or-exit amended by this cached local build, `DYLINT_DRIVER_PATH`
//! caller ownership, and strict-trust refusal) and
//! [`super::ensure_prebuilt_driver`] for how this tier is reached. Unit
//! coverage lives in `dylint_driver_tests.rs`, included as a submodule of
//! the parent `dylint_driver` so its `use super::*;` still resolves these
//! items via the parent's `use local_build::*;` re-export.
