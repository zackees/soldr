//! Broker-owned daemon-disk reclamation (soldr#3251).
//!
//! The broker assigns every daemon generation its disk: a service
//! registration (`<services>/soldr-daemon-<hash>.servicedef.v2`) and a route
//! directory (`<routes>/soldr-daemon-<hash>/`) that holds the staged daemon
//! image. Every distinct daemon build creates both, because the service name
//! is keyed on the image hash. Until this module nothing removed either: one
//! workstation held 782 registrations and 527 route directories (27 GiB)
//! behind a single live route.
//!
//! The broker is the owner because it is the one long-lived process that both
//! creates that disk and knows which generations are live. The per-version
//! runtime sweep (`self_relocate::sweep_route_runtime_copies`) still reclaims
//! old image versions inside a route; this module reclaims whole routes and
//! their registrations.
//!
//! A route is reclaimed only when all of these hold:
//! - its service is not live (no registry entry and no route owners);
//! - it has had no activity for [`DaemonDiskPolicy::protection`];
//! - it is idle past [`DaemonDiskPolicy::idle_ttl`], or it is older than the
//!   newest [`DaemonDiskPolicy::keep_idle_routes`] idle routes.
