//! Process re-entrancy guard (soldr#2547 / soldr#2566, first slice).
//!
//! Every Soldr process stamps `IN_SOLDR_PID=<its pid>` into the environment
//! its children inherit. An ordinary Soldr CLI entry that inherits a foreign
//! marker is a `soldr -> tool -> ... -> soldr` re-entry — the class behind
//! months of hang-shaped incidents (a broker probing `soldr --version`,
//! delegation spawn storms, nested daemon launches). Sanctioned re-entries
//! are mechanically distinguishable: compiler-wrapper invocations, multicall
//! shim identities, and internal spawn edges that already carry their own
//! marker variables.
//!
//! **Enforcement is on by default** (soldr#2739, closing soldr#2547's
//! endgame): an unsanctioned re-entry is an immediate diagnostic + exit 1
//! rather than a silent recursive process tree. Marker stamping happens
//! unconditionally so a child can always judge its parentage, whichever mode
//! the parent ran under.
//!
//! Per-lane opt-in was fragile in exactly the way default-on fixes.
//! soldr#2566 enabled the guard by exporting `strict` from eleven workflows;
//! soldr#2698 then found a lane that had escaped that sweep, i.e. the
//! configuration silently did not apply where it was most needed. A default
//! cannot be missed off a new workflow.
//!
//! `SOLDR_REENTRANCY_GUARD=off` is the single escape hatch, and it is
//! emergency-only: it exists so a user blocked by a false positive can make
//! progress while the false positive is reported, not as a supported
//! configuration. **An unrecognised value is a hard error**, never a silent
//! fallback in either direction — a typo like `SOLDR_REENTRANCY_GUARD=strck`
//! must not quietly disable a safety check, and under the old opt-in default
//! it would have.
//!
//! ### Why the role set is three, not seven
//!
//! soldr#2547 item 2 sketched seven roles; [`Role`] implements three
//! (`FrontDoor`, `Wrapper`, `Broker`). This is deliberate and is the final
//! shape for the default-on flip. A role is only meaningful if some process
//! can *set* it: `soldr-daemon` is a separate binary that never reaches
//! [`enforce_and_mark`], so a `Daemon` variant would be a label nothing could
//! produce. The remaining three — version-probe, version-trampoline and
//! self-relocate — are *edges*, not identities: they describe how a single
//! process was entered, they already carry their own marker variables, and
//! they are matched as such by [`SANCTIONED_EDGE_ENV_VARS`]. Modelling them
//! as roles would mean a process claiming to *be* a trampoline, which is not
//! a thing that outlives the exec.
