//! Routes every cached rustfmt child launched by `soldr cargo fmt` through
//! the daemon's EXISTING resident-capacity admission (soldr#2877).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `cargo fmt` re-enters soldr via the `RUSTFMT` shim
//! (`crate::toolchain::run_rustfmt`), and each formatter child is a plain
//! `rustfmt` process -- never a `CompileRequest`. zccache's compile
//! admission (`crates/soldr-daemon/src/resident_compile_admission.rs`) only
//! ever sees `CompileRequest`s, so it has never seen rustfmt at all: a wide
//! `cargo fmt` fan-out (every crate's formatter launched concurrently by
//! Cargo) is completely invisible to the daemon's existing scheduling, and
//! on a memory-constrained worker that fan-out can OOM the host or race with
//! a concurrent compiler admission for the same resources -- in the worst
//! case truncating a source file rustfmt was mid-write on.
//!
//! This module closes that gap without a wire/protocol change and without a
//! global job cap (see CLAUDE.md's "Concurrency caps are a last resort" --
//! `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` / `SOLDR_JOBS` are never read, set, or modified here).
//! Each rustfmt child now holds [`RUSTFMT_RESIDENT_PERMITS`] permit(s) of the
//! daemon's *existing* compile-capacity semaphore
//! (`crate::daemon::client::acquire_resident_capacity`, the same mechanism
//! `crate::ci_test::nextest_resident_lease` uses for Nextest EXECUTION) for
//! its whole lifetime. Concurrent formatter fan-out is therefore bounded by
//! the same effective capacity `crates/soldr-core/src/core/jobs.rs` already
//! resolves for compiler admission -- rustfmt and rustc children now compete
//! for the one capacity the daemon tracks, instead of rustfmt running
//! entirely outside that accounting.
//!
//! The lease is best-effort: a daemon that is unreachable or refuses the
//! reservation must never fail formatting, so [`RustfmtLeaseController::
//! acquire`] returning `None` still runs the formatter -- it only means the
//! admission signal was unavailable, not that formatting itself failed.
//!
//! # Source-integrity guard
//!
//! Bounding concurrency reduces the chance of a truncated file but does not
//! eliminate it (a killed worker, an OOM signal landing mid-write, a crashed
//! rustfmt child). [`SourceSnapshot`] captures the bytes of every `.rs` file
//! rustfmt was given as an explicit CLI argument *before* it runs, and
//! [`SourceSnapshot::restore_if_damaged`] rewrites any of those files that
//! come back empty (or unreadable) after a failed run, atomically (temp file
//! + rename) so a reader never observes a partial write. Module files that
//! rustfmt discovers on its own beyond the explicit arguments are **not**
//! covered here -- `cargo fmt` always passes each target's root file
//! explicitly, so the explicit-argument set is exactly the set this guard
//! needs to protect.
