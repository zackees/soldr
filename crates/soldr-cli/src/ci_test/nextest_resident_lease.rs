//! Activates the daemon's weighted resident-capacity lease around Fresh
//! Nextest EXECUTION only (soldr#2878's known-open item, filed against
//! soldr#2349/soldr#2878's own dylint-cache-skip regression).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! soldr#2349 taught `soldr ci-test` to skip the six `dylint-library-*`
//! stages on a warm tree. That is correct on its own, but it also removed
//! roughly five minutes of serialized work that had been accidentally
//! staggering the DAG: two consecutive warm CI runs then failed under
//! resource contention on a standard `ubuntu-24.04` GitHub-hosted runner
//! (4 logical CPUs, 16 GiB RAM) --
//!
//! - a nested-cargo Nextest test (`cli_cargo_doc_routes::
//!   bare_doc_keeps_rustc_wrapped_but_rustdoc_direct`) timed out at 77s;
//! - `dylint-test-ban_raw_network_access` exited 101 first, and Nextest was
//!   then killed as collateral. What is established from reading the code
//!   (not run, per this task's constraints):
//!   1. No daemon code sheds an already-running compiler process for memory
//!      pressure -- `ResidentCompileAdmission::acquire_resident`
//!      (`crates/soldr-daemon/src/resident_compile_admission.rs`) only ever
//!      gates *new* admissions, so the daemon cannot have deliberately
//!      killed anything here. That is exactly why the lease -- an input the
//!      admission system can act on before the fact -- is the missing
//!      piece, not a workaround for some other shedding path.
//!   2. The generic signal diagnostic
//!      (`crates/soldr-daemon/src/compiler_exit.rs::signal_diagnostic`)
//!      only formats an *already observed* signal termination; it never
//!      decides to send one.
//!   3. The recorded cgroup evidence for that run
//!      (`oom_kill+oom_group_kill=0` at 13.10 GiB of 16 GiB) rules out the
//!      kernel's cgroup OOM killer as the sender.
//!   4. `execute.rs`'s own sibling-failure cancellation
//!      (`cancel_running`/`cancel_child`, which calls
//!      `kill_cargo_process_tree` -> `terminate_tree` --
//!      `crates/soldr-platform/src/platform_linux/process/terminate.rs`,
//!      SIGTERM then SIGKILL to the whole process group) fully explains
//!      **Nextest's own** collateral death once `ban_raw_network_access`
//!      failed.
//!
//!   What is *not* established by reading alone: whether the SIGTERM to the
//!   compiler compiling `compiletest_rs` (attributed to the UI-test
//!   dependency compile) landed *before* `ban_raw_network_access`'s exit
//!   101 -- in which case it caused the 101 rather than resulted from it --
//!   or after, as executor collateral. The observed ordering
//!   ("`ban_raw_network_access` exited 101 first, Nextest killed as
//!   collateral then") is consistent with either reading once a compiler
//!   subprocess restarts or retries are considered, and this task is
//!   read-only, so the *first* SIGTERM's sender is left undetermined here.
//!   A runner-level memory manager (outside the cgroup this evidence reads)
//!   remains a live candidate precisely because the kernel cgroup OOM
//!   killer is ruled out. Either way, the daemon's compiler-admission
//!   semaphore has never accounted for Nextest's own resident test
//!   processes -- only for compiler processes -- so nothing in the DAG
//!   throttled the combination, and closing that gap is this module's job
//!   regardless of which reading of the collateral kill is correct.
//!
//! The daemon has carried a weighted resident-capacity lease
//! (`crates/soldr-daemon/src/daemon/client.rs::acquire_resident_capacity`,
//! `crates/soldr-daemon/src/resident_compile_admission.rs::
//! ResidentCompileAdmission::acquire_resident`) since the soldr#3037
//! family, but nothing in `soldr-cli` ever called it. This module is the
//! first caller: it reserves a slice of the daemon's compiler-admission
//! semaphore for the lifetime of the Nextest EXECUTION stage, so the
//! daemon's ordinary cache-miss compiler admission (which nested fixture
//! compiles launched *inside* test bodies also go through) sees fewer
//! available slots while Nextest's resident test processes are running --
//! without ever imposing a global Cargo job cap (see CLAUDE.md's "Trap
//! unexpected Cargo calls during Nextest" and "Cgroup memory observations
//! remain telemetry" rules: `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` / `SOLDR_JOBS` stay exactly
//! as the caller set them, unset or not).
//!
//! # Scope: EXECUTION only, never `nextest-compile`
//!
//! `nextest-compile` is a pure compile stage; the daemon's existing
//! shared/exclusive compiler admission already accounts for it like any
//! other compiler unit. Only the EXECUTION stage introduces resident test
//! *processes* the admission semaphore cannot see on its own, so only
//! `crate::ci_test::execute::run_parallel_nextest_and_dylint` (the caller
//! of [`run_nextest_execution`]) wires this module in.
//! `run_parallel_nextest_compile_and_dylint_compile` calls
//! `supervise_parallel_stage_and_dylint` directly and never references
//! [`ResidentLeaseController`] at all, so the compile path cannot acquire
//! this lease even by accident -- there is no parameter through which it
//! could.
