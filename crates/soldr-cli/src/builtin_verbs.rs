//! Built-in verb lists, split out of `cli_args.rs` (soldr#2361 Phase 2 --
//! `cli_args.rs` is over the repo's loc_ratchet ceiling and adding
//! `Commands::Broker` there needed room; this pair of consts plus their
//! predicate is self-contained enough to relocate without touching the
//! `Commands` enum itself).

/// Flat list of every built-in soldr verb that clap recognizes,
/// PLUS aliases (for example, `purge-targets` for `gc`). Used by the
/// fuzzy-match suggestion
/// path in `Commands::External` (issue #412) to detect typos /
/// pre-rename verbs that fell through to the external-tool fetch.
///
/// Must stay in sync with the `Commands` enum + `#[command(alias = ...)]`
/// attributes below. A unit test in `main_tests.rs` walks the const
/// against clap's discovered subcommands and fails when they drift,
/// so adding a new verb here without updating the enum (or vice
/// versa) trips the build.
/// Cargo's own first-party verbs that — when typed bare as
/// `soldr <verb>` — should be routed through soldr's cargo front
/// door (`soldr cargo <verb> ...`) instead of falling through
/// `Commands::External` and attempting a doomed crates.io fetch
/// for a literally-named crate (`build`, `test`, etc. are not
/// real crates). Issue #685, phase 2 of #682.
///
/// The collision verbs `clean`, `config`, and `version` are
/// deliberately EXCLUDED — those map to soldr-native built-ins
/// that clap captures before the External arm runs. `soldr cargo
/// clean` / `soldr cargo config` continue to work as the explicit
/// escape hatch. A unit test in `main_tests.rs` asserts the
/// exclusion stays in place.
///
/// The list is intentionally a superset of cargo's own `--list`
/// output of first-party commands; new cargo verbs (rare) need an
/// explicit add here.
