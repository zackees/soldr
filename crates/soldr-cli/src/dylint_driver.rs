//! The Dylint *driver* half of what used to be one `dylint_toolchain.rs`
//! (soldr#2945).
//!
//! `dylint_toolchain.rs` answers a single question — *which nightly does this
//! workspace's Dylint run against, and who decided that?* — and hands back a
//! [`DylintToolchainPlan`]. Everything in this file starts where that answer
//! ends: given a settled plan, it locates the matching `dylint-driver` binary
//! on disk, proves the binary is the one the pinned cargo-dylint expects,
//! fetches it from the soldr-toolchain catalogue when it is absent, and builds
//! the runtime environment (`PATH` / `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
//! the driver needs to load the nightly's `rustc_private` shared libraries.
//! The two halves share only the plan type and the "is this a fully-qualified
//! nightly name?" predicate, which is what made the seam obvious once the file
//! had to be cut.
//!
//! The cut itself was forced: `.github/scripts/loc_ceiling.py` enforces a
//! **hard** 1,000-physical-line ceiling on every production source under
//! `crates/*/src/`, and unlike `loc_ratchet.py` there is no grandfathering and
//! no "it was already over" escape — a violating file fails the `Lint` job
//! whether or not the PR touched it. soldr#2945 took `dylint_toolchain.rs` from
//! 987 lines to 1,265 by threading `ChannelProvenance` through the resolver
//! and rewriting the driver-gate diagnostic, which put it 265 lines over. This
//! module is that overage, moved rather than trimmed: nothing here changed
//! behaviour on the way across.
//!
//! Two policies live here and are easy to break by accident, so they are stated
//! once, loudly:
//!
//! * **Binary-or-exit** (soldr#2432/#2484). Upstream cargo-dylint silently
//!   builds a missing or stale driver from source, which installs `rustc-dev`
//!   for the nightly and costs minutes. Soldr refuses instead, and
//!   [`require_prebuilt_driver`] preflights the *same* version signal
//!   cargo-dylint would have checked so the refusal happens at Soldr's front
//!   door rather than several minutes into a nested build. The single opt-in is
//!   `wrapper::ALLOW_DYLINT_DRIVER_BUILD_ENV_VAR` — deliberately the same
//!   variable the nested-build guard in `wrapper.rs` honours, so a user who
//!   turns the policy off is not stopped a second time by a guard that
//!   disagrees about which switch turns it off.
//! * **`DYLINT_DRIVER_PATH` belongs to the caller when the caller sets it.**
//!   Every path decision in this file consults it first and never clobbers it.
//!
//! Unit coverage for this module lives in `dylint_toolchain_tests.rs` beside
//! the resolver tests it shares its `EnvVarGuard` / sample-plan scaffolding
//! with, and reaches these items through `crate::dylint_driver::…`.
