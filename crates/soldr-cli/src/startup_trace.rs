//! Per-phase startup breadcrumbs for the CLI front door (soldr#2571).
//!
//! [`crate::broker_bringup`] did this for `soldr broker serve` after soldr#2493
//! showed that a broker which hangs between "starting" and "started" is
//! undiagnosable. soldr#2571 is the same failure one process to the left:
//! `doctor --json` wedged for the full 15 s test budget having written **zero
//! bytes to stdout and stderr**, with the fixture's `broker-spawn.log` proving
//! the broker came up in 86 ms and `daemon-spawn.log` proving the daemon was
//! serving. Both peers were exonerated and the client still could not say what
//! it was doing, because the front door announces nothing until the command
//! body produces output — and `doctor` produces its first byte only at the
//! closing `print_json`.
//!
//! So every startup boundary reports the moment it is crossed, eagerly, and a
//! wedged process leaves behind a trail whose **last line names the phase that
//! was entered but never finished**.
//!
//! # Why stderr only, and no durable log
//!
//! [`crate::broker_bringup`] also writes `broker-bringup.jsonl`, because a
//! production broker's stderr goes to a log nobody reads interactively. The
//! front door is the opposite: its stderr is right there in the terminal, and
//! in CI it is captured by whatever spawned it (`run_soldr_with_timeout`
//! already dumps both streams into its panic message).
//!
//! More decisively, a file sink would have to resolve `~/.soldr` first — and
//! home resolution, path canonicalization, and broker-directory creation are
//! themselves candidate wedge phases here. **A tracer must not depend on the
//! machinery it is tracing.** `eprintln!` needs nothing but the inherited fd.
//!
//! # Why this is not `SOLDR_PROFILE_STARTUP`
//!
//! [`crate::startup_profile`] measures the same kind of thing but prints its
//! breakdown from `finish()`, at the end. A process that never reaches the end
//! prints nothing at all, which is precisely the soldr#2571 signature. This
//! module trades the tidy summary for a line per boundary as it happens.
//!
//! # Contract notes
//!
//! * `total_ms` is measured from the **first** [`phase`] call, not from process
//!   start: the `main.rs` re-spawn onto the big-stack thread and argv collection
//!   precede it. That gap is sub-millisecond and unmeasurable from here anyway;
//!   what matters is that *no* trace lines at all still means "wedged before the
//!   first mark", which is a diagnosis of its own.
//! * Output is opt-in via `SOLDR_STARTUP_TRACE`, so it does **not** violate the
//!   soldr#2554 rule that `--json` / `--shell-export` output must stay
//!   machine-parseable when stdout and stderr are merged. Setting the variable
//!   *is* the caller's consent to extra stderr; an unset variable is byte-for-
//!   byte the old behavior.
//! * For the same reason the marks in `broker_spawn::ensure_stable_broker_ready`
//!   are **not** gated on that module's `diagnostics_eligible`. That flag
//!   suppresses unasked-for warnings on `--json` / `--shell-export` invocations
//!   — which is precisely the shape that wedged in soldr#2571, so folding these
//!   marks into it would silence the one case they exist to explain. Do not
//!   "fix" the asymmetry; it is the point.
