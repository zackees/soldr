// Which C runtime the caller asked the MSVC cross-link to use (soldr#2794).
//
// `soldr build --target *-pc-windows-msvc` injects the UCRT/VCRuntime
// **import** libraries so clang-cl's default `/MD` mode resolves its
// `__declspec(dllimport)` references. That is right until the caller also
// passes `-C target-feature=+crt-static`, at which point rustc emits
// `/defaultlib:libcmt` and the link line carries *both* CRTs:
//
// ```text
// lld-link: error: duplicate symbol: __vcrt_InitializeCriticalSectionEx
//   >>> libvcruntime.lib(winapi_downlevel.obj)   (static)
//   >>> vcruntime.lib(VCRUNTIME140.dll)          (dynamic)
// ```
//
// soldr was hard-coding a *policy* (dynamic CRT) into what is otherwise
// toolchain *plumbing* (linker flavor + library search paths). This module
// reads the policy back off the caller instead. Upstream `cargo-xwin` made
// the same change in 0.20.0 (rust-cross/cargo-xwin#166); soldr needs it for
// `vcruntime` as well as `ucrt`, because soldr injects a `vcruntime` default
// that cargo-xwin does not.
//
// ## Everything here is pure
//
// Detection takes its inputs as arguments rather than reading the process
// environment, so the tests never mutate a shared variable. That is not
// incidental tidiness: `tests/guards/env_lock_lint.rs` requires every mutated
// variable to sit under a single barrier, and `RUSTFLAGS` is already mutated
// under two others. A pure core sidesteps the question — only
// [`requested_crt_linkage`] touches the environment, and it does nothing but
// gather strings and delegate.
