//! `soldr wheel [--release] [--target <triple>]` — the blessed Python wheel
//! surface (soldr#2139 gap 1).
//!
//! # Why a verb rather than a flag
//!
//! `soldr build --wheel` would overload the blessed-toolchain verb with a
//! different *output artifact*, and `soldr maturin build` looks like a
//! passthrough while silently doing sysroot preparation. `wheel` says what it
//! produces and is honest about doing work first.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! A thin front end over the existing `soldr maturin ...` execution path. It
//! resolves the friendly target alias, picks maturin's `--compatibility`
//! value from the target family, and hands a `maturin build ...` argument
//! vector back to the ordinary dispatcher — which already owns maturin
//! provisioning, toolchain env pinning, the build lease, target preparation
//! (`target_lifecycle::prepare_for_invocation`), and the PyO3 plan. Nothing
//! about the wheel *naming* contract is touched; that is downstream-visible
//! and is maturin's to decide.
//!
//! # Scope: abi3 only
//!
//! A non-abi3 extension module has to link against a CPython built for the
//! *target*, which is a materially harder problem than mounting a sysroot.
//! abi3 needs no target-side interpreter, and it covers soldr's own wheel.
//! Anything the PyO3 planner cannot place in an interpreter-free mode is
//! refused with a message naming `soldr maturin build` as the escape hatch,
//! rather than silently degrading into a wheel built against the host's
//! Python.
//!
//! # Grammar
//!
//! ```text
//! soldr wheel                              # quick dev wheel, host target
//! soldr wheel --release                    # release wheel, host target
//! soldr wheel --release --target XXX       # release wheel, cross target
//! soldr wheel --release --host-glibc       # release wheel, host glibc floor
//! ```
//!
//! `--release` is opt-in, matching `cargo` and `soldr build`: the default is a
//! fast dev-profile wheel. `--target` defaults to the host triple.
//!
//! # Note on glibc floors — only claim a floor soldr enforced
//!
//! `--compatibility manylinux_2_17` is a *tag*, and the suffixed-triple floor
//! (`...-linux-gnu.2.17`, soldr#2202) means "ask zig for this floor", never
//! "guarantee this floor" — the effective floor is the max of what zig was
//! asked for and every symbol the vendored C dependencies reference. The
//! suffixed spelling is therefore rejected here rather than being quietly
//! accepted into a wheel tag that would read as a promise.
//!
//! The same honesty rule governs the tag soldr emits at all: soldr claims
//! `manylinux_2_17` only for a build in which
//! `target_lifecycle::prepare_for_invocation` ran and mounted the catalogue
//! glibc-2.17 sysroot that *creates* the floor. `verify_wheel_glibc.py` exists
//! precisely because pip *trusts* that claim and installs the wheel anyway.
//!
//! The maturin execution path prepares a target on its own only when the
//! target differs from the host. soldr#3432 closed the gap that left: a
//! `--release` `*-linux-gnu` wheel **always** gets target preparation, host
//! target included, via `maturin_target_needs_prep`. A release wheel is the
//! thing that goes to PyPI, and it must never silently inherit the build
//! machine's glibc floor (2.39 on ubuntu-24.04). So "release + linux-gnu"
//! means an enforced 2.17 floor, and soldr says so on stderr with one green
//! `info` line ([`GlibcNotice`]) so the floor is never a silent choice.
//!
//! The opt-out is explicit: `--host-glibc` skips the forced preparation for a
//! host-target build, links against this host's glibc, and passes
//! `--compatibility pypi` — maturin's "work the tag out from the bytes"
//! pseudo-option — because that is the only claim soldr can back. A dev wheel
//! gets the same `pypi` treatment: it is a local artifact, and a dev wheel
//! tagged `manylinux_2_17` without the sysroot would be a lie pip acts on.
//!
//! A host that cannot run the catalogue GNU bundle (every bundle is
//! x86_64-hosted, soldr#2874 — so a native aarch64 Linux host) cannot enforce
//! the floor for a host-target release wheel. soldr refuses rather than
//! falling back: the same rule `target_lifecycle::decide_gnu_bundle` applies to
//! an explicit `.2.17` floor request, where a silent success is worse than a
//! failure because the artifact would read as a promise. The refusal names both
//! remedies (cross-build from x86_64, or `--host-glibc`).
//!
//! musl is deliberately unchanged: a host-target musl wheel still gets `pypi`.
//! The catalogue musl bundle is hosted on `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, which a
//! musl host (the only place a host-target musl build happens) is not
//! guaranteed to be able to execute, so the glibc fix does not carry over
//! (soldr#3435).
//!
//! Note that maturin does **not** paper over a bad claim: with an explicit
//! `--compatibility manylinux_2_17` and an ELF needing `GLIBC_2.39`,
//! `auditwheel_rs` (maturin `src/auditwheel/linux.rs`) returns
//! `VersionedSymbolTooNewError` from the explicit-tag branch and the build
//! fails with "Error ensuring manylinux_2_17 compliance" — it downgrades only
//! when *no* tag was requested. `AuditWheelMode::Repair` is maturin's
//! `#[default]`, so `release-auto.yml`'s explicit `--auditwheel repair`
//! restates the default and its absence here changes nothing.
