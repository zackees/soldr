Equivalent to SOLDR_JOBS=N, and takes the same top precedence: above `[jobs].max_parallel_compiles` in config.toml, and above the legacy ZCCACHE_MAX_PARALLEL_COMPILES. Left unset, the default leaves one logical CPU free, and on an SMT machine additionally caps at (physical cores + 2) so a build cannot saturate every hardware thread — 10 on an 8-core/16-thread host. A machine without SMT keeps all its slots, and if the CPU topology cannot be read the limit falls back to one less than the logical CPU count.

This governs the daemon, not cargo. `--jobs` is soldr's own flag at every position, so `soldr build --jobs 1` caps the daemon and leaves cargo's parallelism at its default (soldr#2786).

To set cargo's job count explicitly, any of these reach it: `soldr build -j N` (the short form is not soldr's), `soldr build -- --jobs N`, or `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=N`. Soldr preserves that explicit value. An OOM is a scheduling/admission defect to diagnose from compiler and cgroup telemetry, not a signal for Soldr to silently lower Cargo's global parallelism.

Applies to a daemon this invocation starts. A daemon already running keeps the limit it started with, so run `soldr daemon stop` first to change it."
