//! Driver-gate tests for the `soldr cargo dylint` front door.
//!
//! Split out of `tests.rs` (soldr#2945): that file is long past the
//! per-file ceiling and the ratchet refuses to let it grow, so the
//! assertions this change needed had to land somewhere new. The driver
//! gate is a self-contained contract -- a channel, a published asset, and
//! the refusal that fires when they do not line up -- so it is a natural
//! seam rather than an arbitrary cut.
