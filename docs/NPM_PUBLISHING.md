# npm Publishing

This repository publishes `soldr` to npm as a thin JavaScript wrapper around the
official GitHub Release binaries. The npm package does not build Rust from
source during install.

## Package Shape

- package name: `@zackees/soldr`
- executable: `soldr`
- install step: downloads the matching GitHub Release archive for the current
  OS/architecture
- verification: checks the downloaded archive against
  `soldr-vX.Y.Z-SHA256SUMS.txt` before installing the binary
- linux fallback: on Linux the installer tries the sibling libc artifact when
  the selected one fails (see 'Linux libc Selection And Sibling Fallback'
  below)
- binary sharing: npm installs the same GitHub Release binary that the release
  workflow attests, and PyPI wheels are built from that same per-platform target
  binary before publication

Supported npm install targets match the release workflow:

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
- `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`

## Linux libc Selection And Sibling Fallback

The npm postinstall picks the Linux artifact with `detectLibc()` in
`scripts/install.js`. Selection runs in this order:

1. If a musl loader is present in `/lib` (`ld-musl-*.so.1`), the SYSTEM is
   musl, and that outranks whatever Node itself was linked against.
2. Otherwise, Node's reported runtime glibc version picks `-gnu` only at or
   above `MIN_GLIBC_FOR_GNU`.
3. Anything unknown falls back to musl, which is verified statically linked
   before staging and therefore also runs correctly on glibc hosts.

`MIN_GLIBC_FOR_GNU` is currently `2.39`. It is kept in lockstep with the
`--max-glibc` ceiling that `release-auto.yml` passes to
`.github/scripts/verify_glibc_baseline.py` by an assertion in
`scripts/test-npm-package.js`: when the release build moves to a 2.17
baseline, the installer constant follows it down.

soldr#1060 adds a sibling-libc retry on top of that selection. The installer
builds an ordered candidate list, and if the selected artifact fails for any
reason -- a missing asset or HTTP error, a checksum mismatch, an extraction
failure, or a bundled binary missing from the archive -- it retries the
sibling libc artifact for the same architecture (musl instead of gnu, or gnu
instead of musl) and logs which candidate it fell back to and why. The rule
is "retry the other libc", not "always retry gnu", because the selection
above already prefers gnu once the host glibc is new enough.

Non-Linux platforms are single-candidate: macOS and Windows have no sibling
libc, so a failure there is reported rather than silently substituted with a
different triple.

Either way the log identifies the outcome. On a successful fallback it names
the triple that failed, the reason, and the triple that was installed
instead. When every candidate fails, the installer raises a single error
listing each triple it tried alongside that candidate's own failure reason,
so no attempt's error is swallowed on the way to the final one.

The ordering helper (`platformCandidates`) resolves its preferred artifact by
calling `platformTarget`, so there is exactly one implementation of "which
artifact does this host want?" -- including its unsupported-platform error.
The sibling is then derived from the resolved triple rather than re-read from
the libc argument.

`SOLDR_NPM_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1`, documented below, still short-circuits before
any candidate is attempted.

Intel macOS archives and wheels are cross-built on Linux through the blessed
Apple SDK path, then architecture-checked and smoke-tested inside a
[zackees/docker-mac-x64](https://github.com/zackees/docker-mac-x64) macOS
Recovery guest hosted on an `ubuntu-24.04` runner (soldr#3076 -- no GitHub
Actions job may run on a `macos-*` runner) before GitHub Release, PyPI, or
npm publication. Only the archive's binaries are executed there (Recovery has
no Python); the wheel keeps a Linux-side METADATA-version check. Apple
Silicon (`aarch64-apple-darwin`) artifacts are cross-built the same way but
are not smoke-tested anywhere in CI until soldr#3071 re-enables execution
before release.

## Owner Setup

Before automated npm publication can work, configure npm Trusted Publishing for
the package. The package has already been created manually, so it can now be
connected to GitHub Actions OIDC.

1. Open the npm package settings for `@zackees/soldr`.
2. In the package publishing settings, add this GitHub trusted publisher:
   - repository owner: `zackees`
   - repository name: `soldr`
   - workflow filename: `release-auto.yml`
   - environment: `release`
3. Keep the repository URL in `package.json` pointed at
   `git+https://github.com/zackees/soldr.git`; npm checks that for trusted
   publishing.
4. Optionally set the package to require 2FA and disallow tokens after the
   trusted publisher is configured.

The workflow uses npm Trusted Publishing directly:

- `.github/workflows/release-auto.yml`
- job: `publish-npm`
- environment: `release`
- permissions: `id-token: write`, `contents: read`
- Node: `24`
- npm CLI: `11.12.1`
- idempotency: the job skips `npm publish` when an npm dist-tag already points
  at the exact package version

Do not add `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` for this job. npm exchanges the GitHub OIDC token
for publish credentials when the trusted publisher configuration matches.

## Release Order

The npm package version must match `Cargo.toml`. The release workflow publishes
npm only after the GitHub Release job succeeds, because the npm postinstall
script downloads artifacts from that release.

For manual validation before publishing:

```bash
node scripts/test-npm-package.js
npm pack --dry-run
```

To test the install script without downloading a release artifact:

```bash
SOLDR_NPM_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
```

Do not publish an npm version until the matching GitHub Release has these files:

- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.zst`
- `soldr-vX.Y.Z-SHA256SUMS.txt`

Each archive is a `.tar.zst` at zstd compression level 19 and bundles
soldr, soldr-daemon, crgx, cargo-chef, and a `manifest.json` at
the archive root. Windows archives also include soldr's matching PDB
sidecar:

- `soldr` (or `soldr.exe`) — the soldr CLI itself.
- `soldr-daemon` (or `soldr-daemon.exe`) — soldr-owned daemon for the
  embedded cache service.
- Toolchain, clang, and `zccache-soldr` shim names are hardlinks/copies
  of `soldr` created at install time; they are not archive entries.
- `soldr.pdb` or `soldr_cli.pdb` - Windows-only soldr debug symbols
  recorded under `soldr.debug_info` in `manifest.json`.
- `crgx` (or `crgx.exe`) - the matching-target crgx binary.
- `cargo-chef` (or `cargo-chef.exe`) - the pinned cargo-chef binary used
  by `soldr cook`.
- `manifest.json` - schema_version 4 descriptor with soldr / embedded
  zccache / crgx / cargo-chef versions, target triples, soldr
  debug-info sidecars, per-file sha256s, archive format, and explicit
  build/execution provenance for the archive and wheel. `not-executed` is a
  literal absence of runtime coverage; it must never be read as a successful
  cross-build smoke.
  The expected archive layout is versioned in
  `contracts/zccache-runtime.v1.json`.

The npm install wrapper validates `manifest.json`, unpacks the release binaries
plus any soldr debug-info sidecars into `bin/native/`, and `bin/soldr.js`
exports `SOLDR_CRGX_LOCAL_DIR` and `SOLDR_CARGO_CHEF_LOCAL_DIR` to that dir
before spawning soldr, so the bundled tools are picked up automatically.
