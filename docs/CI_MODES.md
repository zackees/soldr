# CI modes

The `CI` workflow selects one mode for each event. An ordinary maintainer pull request or
push to `main` runs `Lint` and the Linux x64 prescribed host validation
(`soldr ci-test`). The Linux host job is not the whole platform matrix.


A PR author without effective `write`, `maintain`, or `admin` permission on
the base repository receives full tests without a label. Permission is queried
anew on each run; unavailable, malformed, stale, or mismatched responses choose
full. Fork origin, association strings, prior contributions, and bot identity
do not grant trust. Label removal cannot downgrade an external author. The
selector reports `author_permission` and `selector_schema=fleet-ci-mode/v1`,
and executes from the trusted base SHA rather than the PR helper. The shared
selector interface and remaining adoption work are described in
[the fleet contract](FLEET_CI_CONTRACT.md). GitHub maps
maintain to the API's write permission; custom role names alone grant nothing.
See [GitHub's permission API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/collaborators/collaborators#get-repository-permissions-for-a-user).

External PRs must not merge until `Full coverage` proves every required cell
succeeded on their candidate. Live external-PR proof, stable summary branch
protection, and shared fleet adoption are tracked in
[setup-soldr#523](https://github.com/zackees/setup-soldr/issues/523). External
full runs are reported separately from the trusted routine compute budget.

Add the `ci-test` label to run the extended Linux x64 target E2E cell and
the macOS ARM64 archive replay on a hosted `macos-15` runner. Remove it to
return to minimal coverage on the same PR head SHA. This does not run the
complete platform matrix.

Add the `ci-full` label to a pull request when it changes platform-sensitive
code, cross-target behavior, the toolchain, sysroots, wheels, target execution,
or release packaging. Label add/remove and new commits recompute the mode for
the PR head SHA. `ci-full` takes precedence over the older `fast-build` label
and `ci-test` and path-based Windows/wheel policies. Full mode runs every CI
target in `ci/canonical-targets.json` and the platform smoke jobs. `Full
coverage` fails when a required job is skipped, failed, cancelled, or missing.
It also rejects a supported target with no execution job. Full mode replays
the macOS x64 archive on hosted `macos-15-intel` and the ARM64 archive on
hosted `macos-15`. These runner allocations occur for explicit labels, external-author full
validation, or exact-SHA release validation. Trusted unlabeled PRs and main
runs remain Mac-free.

For a release candidate, dispatch `CI` with `candidate_sha` set to its full
40-character commit SHA. The mode job checks out and verifies that SHA, then
passes it to every checkout and cross-build caller. A release process must wait
for a successful `Full coverage` result on that same SHA before publication.

The GNU/Linux wheel verification cells canary the release wheel helper with
`soldr wheel --release --target <triple> --locked --strip --target-dir target
--out dist`. Both x64 host and ARM64 cross wheels must pass the manylinux tag
and GLIBC 2.17 byte checks; the host wheel also passes the release installation
smoke test. This validates the release build path without publishing. Wheel
provisioning belongs to Soldr; the helper does not source-build Maturin or use
setup-soldr's `target-wheel-hook` for GNU/Linux. The project's `auditwheel =
"check"` policy remains authoritative, and these steps build wheels only, not
sdists. Native ARM64 musl retains its explicit native builder: the catalogue
compiler is x86_64-hosted and cannot execute on that runner (see
[soldr#3435](https://github.com/zackees/soldr/issues/3435)).

The normal `Lint` and `Linux x64` status names remain stable for branch
protection. A full run additionally reports `Full coverage`. The runner-minute
budget in [soldr#3344](https://github.com/zackees/soldr/issues/3344) is for all
workflows caused by the event; it needs Actions job-duration measurements and
cannot be inferred from this workflow's job count.

Manual npm recovery is partial publication and requires `candidate_sha` and
`full_ci_run_id` too. A completed main-workflow full run must prove that exact
candidate, and the immutable recovery tag must resolve to the tested SHA before
npm publication. A missing, skipped, failed, or stale full gate refuses recovery.

The cost collector groups direct PR/main runs by SHA and explicit event-wave
anchor, then follows versioned `ci-cost-parent-v1=<run-id>` receipts in chained
workflow run titles. These parent IDs come from GitHub's `workflow_run` payload;
matching SHAs or timestamps alone do not establish attribution. Chained jobs
can finish much later or run a newer default-branch SHA and still belong to the
original event. Missing receipts or pending selected runs refuse a cost report,
so older runs without causal receipts cannot silently count as a complete
whole-event measurement. Direct and chained jobs include every attempt; skipped
jobs consume zero runner time. Run the collector after the expected workflow
graph has completed and review its included/excluded run inventory.

The collector also checks API `total_count` against its paginated inventory and
refuses searches at [GitHub's 1,000-result limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs#list-workflow-runs-for-a-repository).
A truncated or changing inventory cannot support a budget claim.

Setup Soldr Action smoke and Cook Size Gate are required full-mode jobs. They
check out the same candidate SHA as the target matrix and no longer run on
ordinary PR or main events. Explicit manual smoke dispatches remain available;
full validation, rather than each main push, seeds their base-branch caches.


The `Full coverage` job emits a `fleet-ci-coverage/v1` JSON artifact for each
run attempt, with the candidate SHA, selected SHA, manifest SHA-256, required
job IDs, outcomes, and failures. Wrong or missing candidate identity refuses
coverage even if every supplied job state says success. Failed coverage reports
remain diagnostic artifacts; they do not authorize publication.

Other fleet repositories can pin and execute the same `ci_full_coverage.py`
helper with `--contract <adapter.json> --expected-sha <candidate>
--selected-sha <selector-output> --report <coverage.json>`, and supply their
GitHub `needs` object in `CI_NEEDS_JSON`. A portable adapter declares
`schema_version: 1`, a nonempty unique `required_jobs` list, and `targets` with
`triple` (an opaque target identity) plus `ci.build_job` and `ci.run_job`. A
declared target without an execution job fails, including documented exceptions.
The adapter replaces Soldr's smoke-job defaults; its complete test inventory
must be reviewed and proven by live runs. Consumer rollout remains under
[soldr#3345](https://github.com/zackees/soldr/issues/3345).

`CI summary` is the stable merge context and runs with `always()` after the
selector and required cells. It checks `ci/summary-contract.json` for minimal,
documentation-only, and extended-test jobs; full mode additionally checks the
canonical target contract and `Full coverage`. Every selected job must finish
successfully on the selected candidate identity. An unresolved/external PR
author cannot use a minimal or test summary, and a dispatch requires full mode.
The summary uploads an attempt-specific `fleet-ci-summary/v1` diagnostic report
with both contract digests, identity, permission class, outcomes, and failures.

Both `ci-test` and `ci-full` override documentation-only host/lint skips, so the
extended tier can actually execute its declared extra tests. Minimal docs-only
PRs require the documentation lint and a successful path-selection decision.
Informational reld probes remain advisory and are not declared merge gates.

Branch protection must require `CI summary` only after a successful default-
branch run proves the context exists. The repository currently has no required
checks; shipping the summary alone does not prove protected enforcement or the
fleet's external-author security and live-run acceptance criteria.
